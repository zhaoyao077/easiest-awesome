If there are not a lot, it would be great to fix them together. If the occurrences are a lot, feel free to create a separate PR.

It's not super hard. But it's a bit odd to add this alone to pandas API on Spark. We should probably think about adding grpcio as a hard dependency for whole PySpark project, but definitely not alone for pandas API on Spark.

> What are we achieving with this? GRPC is a stable protocol and not a random library. It's available throughout all platforms.

So for the current status, we're trying to add the dependencies that the module need so users won't need to install the unnecessary dependency. In addition, adding the dependency breaks existing applications when they migrate from 3.4 to 3.5. It matters when PySpark is installed without `pip` (which is actually the official release channel of Apache Spark).

6477701,2023/5/19,v3.2.4,"@LuciferYang would you mind trying to merge this into `master` branch by `./dev/merge_spark_pr.py` when the tests pass? It would require you to set several environment variables like `JIRA_USERNAME`, and set the `remote` (please also read `./dev/merge_spark_pr.py` script). You should also install `pip install jira` (https://pypi.org/project/jira/) before running that script.

For example, this is my remote:

```
git remote -v

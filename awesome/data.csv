I played a bit with the UI while making this PR and it looked ok to me.

Actually, I'm not sure that anything from our customizations in `core/src/main/resources/org/apache/spark/ui/static/webui-dataTables.css` is still needed after this version update, but I removed only the up/dpwn arrows related part that caused issues...
E.g. the executor ""show ... entries"" box (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36226#issuecomment-1100810575) looked ok without this last fix: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36226/files#diff-e96c8dc10974b7da0c5dd4f675702462124b66c4bf2f7a0682f2ec1482a2eee3","1,-1    ",1,-1,0

1445466115,24260474,2023/2/16,v3.3.2,"Also, I'd like to share some performance measurements from my local machine, using JMH:
code example:
```java
...
    @Benchmark
    public void convert_branch_master(Blackhole bh) {
        // Convert to unsigned
        for (int i = -10_000; i < 10_000; i++) {
            UTF8String convert = NumberConverter
                    .convert(UTF8String.fromString(String.valueOf(i)).getBytes(), 10, 16);
            bh.consume(convert);
        }

        // Convert to signed
        for (int i = -10_000; i < 10_000; i++) {
            UTF8String convert = NumberConverter
                    .convert(UTF8String.fromString(String.valueOf(i)).getBytes(), 10, -16);
            bh.consume(convert);
        }
    }
...

// the same code for SPARK-42399 branch
```

With Java 8, current PR even speeds up the performance:
```java

NumberConverterBenchmark.convert_branch_spark42399  avgt   10  22.857 ± 0.421  ms/op

```

With Java 11, implementation from master branch works more then 2 times faster than the same implementation with Java 8!
But there is not a big gap in performance difference between master branch implementation and implementation from current branch. 
```java

```

With Java 17, implementation from master branch works more then 3 times faster than the same implementation with Java 8 and ~ 2 times faster then the same implementation with Java 11!
And here is a significant difference between master branch implementation and current branch (master branch is ~2x times faster...).

We can persist those in the class - and make jobId a `transient lazy val` which recreates it each time.

Something like this instead:

```

  private[this] val jobIdParts: (String, Int) = {
    val id = SparkHadoopWriterUtils.createJobID(new Date, 0)

I think We should see similar errors here: https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark/actions/runs/4206035140/jobs/7299042843 later

2. then I want to test maven 3.9.0 + CycloneDX 2.7.4 couple of days ago, but there an error same as  `maven 3.8.7 + cyclonedx-maven-plugin 2.7.4`,  I think we should see it here: https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark/runs/11424487074 later

3. then I test maven 3.9.0 + CycloneDX 2.7.5 today, there is no above issues(we can check https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark/runs/11424568023 later).

So If I want to upgrade Spark to use maven 3.9.0, I must upgrade cyclonedx-maven-plugin to 2.7.5, I should upgrade them in one or two pr?

If you want to claim this PR as a blocker, you need to do that properly. In general, you had better do two things at least.
- Ping, @xinrong-meng , in order to inform her the existence of the blocker.
- Update SPARK-42486 properly. Currently, the JIRA Affected Version is quite opposite from your comment (or intention) here.

A couple of things I would like to highlight. The scala clients tries to be as compatible as possible (both source and binary) with the exiting API. That is why this is different that API that is built on top of the scala API, that was new, this however is not, it should be or at least aspires to be the same API. Hence my argument that you could also use the original since tags. Anyway I am fine with updating them, like I did in other PRs, I just missed it in this case.

As for the removal of deprecated methods. Again we want to be as compatible as possible, so I want to given users access to them. We aspire that in the best case a user can migrate their code to connect without any issues (preferably no recompilation). I don't think we should ever remove these methods, they are poorly named that is all. They do not inhibit us in any way to keep evolving Spark since they are just aliases. I have kept out a few deprecated methods in the current connect Dataset, but I do intent to bring them back once we can support them.

Couple of questions

1.  Is it required and documented that we should add  alias with the aggregate functions? If that is not a requirement then fixing the test case is potentially  covering an issue.
2. The Thread leaks reported in the sql-other tests in not just from DataFrameAggregateSuite, but from multiple other suites

I am attaching a file showing some failures when all the aggregate expressions were made UnresolvedAlias. My latest checkin where I only make those aggregate expressions that have ""*"" as UnresolvedAlias works. The build went through.So it is essentially the unresolvedstar() that is being produced by the toPrettySQL  for the agg expr with star that the Analyzer is not able to resolve.

Please assure that the description of the PR is accurate and up to date (or have a pointer to a google-doc that does the same).
We cannot reciew code against itself. We have to review it against a common understanding on what it is meant to do.

The change to clean up the upload directory is not specific to HDFS. The reason we should do cleanup is because if the spark job is creating new directories/files, it should clean them up too just like it's being done in YARN and also for other files like shuffle spill. 
Also, can you please explain why the approach seems to be incomplete? How is unable to prevent leftover from upload directory?","1,-1    ",1,-1,0

1. It seems that you have an assumption that Shutdown hook is magically reliable. However, shutdown hook has a well-known limitation where JVM can be destroyed abruptly and K8s Pod can be deleted also without giving the inside processes enough time to handle business logic.

2. As I mentioned in the above, public cloud storage systems have a better and complete TTL-based solution for that issue. In that context, this PR is only trying to mitigate HDFS issue, https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-6382, partially.

1442630247,9616802,2023/2/28,v3.4.0-rc1,"@xkrogen yes, Spark Connect decouples client and server. That we synchronize jars and REPL generated classes does not mean we are re-introducing the coupling between client and server. All it means is that we will be using the server (driver) to orchistrate the execution of user defined code. This code could be executed within the same engine, however we can also use separate processes or VMs to execute this code. I do feel that adding this kind of functionality to connect keeps thing simple from the client's POV; it does not make a lot sense to me to do the synchronisation through a different service, because we need to go through the driver anyway.

I do want to call out that this mechanism is just not here for JARs and REPL generated classed, but that there are also quite a few other use cases that we need this mechanism for, e.g.: reading client local files, synchronizing other kinds of dependencies (for example python wheels), uploading models, ...

Finally it is early days for connect. We currently want to make it easy to folks to try and to move to connect. We need a REPL experience that is similar to the current experience for that. We want to do the simple thing first, and that is reuse the current UDF execution code (with some classpath isolation). I am happy to discuss the steps after that, if you are up to that please reach out to me (herman@databricks.com).","1,-1    ",1,-1,0

Good point; nothing about the protocol itself precludes us from using separate UDF processes in the future.

> Finally it is early days for connect. We currently want to make it easy to folks to try and to move to connect ...

Generally agreed, but APIs and contracts can be challenging to change once adopted, so it's important to get it right on the first try, at least to the extent that it doesn't force us into bad decisions or tech debt later. That's why I'm interested in discussing a longer-term roadmap about this kind of support.

But I think you have convinced me that this protocol is generally useful!

Yeah, if the test failures look related, let's fix them.

If there are not a lot, it would be great to fix them together. If the occurrences are a lot, feel free to create a separate PR.

> - I have a workflow error,  Workflow run detection failed, i enabled github actions on my forked repo, how can i re run the tests?

If you rebase or merge the upstream, the test will be triggered, and the GitHub check status will be updated.

For the deprecations introduced by numpy 1.24.0 and greping master branch as cloned yesterday:

```
spark % git grep np.object0
python/pyspark/sql/pandas/conversion.py:                                np.object0 if pandas_type is None else pandas_type

spark % git grep np.bytes0
spark % git grep np.void0
spark % git grep np.int0
spark % git grep np.uint0
spark % git grep np.bool8

As we see we have only one np.object0 so we are pretty safe with these numpy changes.

Actually to make it even more clear, 

The only changes that are functional are related with the conversion.py file. The rest of the changes are inside tests in the user_guide or in some docstrings describing specific functions. Since I am not an expert in these tests I wait for the reviewer and some people with more experience in the pyspark code.

But for your question, these types are aliases for classic python types so yes they should work with all the numpy versions [1](https://numpy.org/devdocs/release/1.20.0-notes.html), [2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74844262/how-can-i-solve-error-module-numpy-has-no-attribute-float-in-python). The error or warning comes from the call to the numpy.

I attached 2 links which explain the use-case.","1,-1    ",1,-1,0

The reason why we get ambiguous error in below scenario and why it's not correct is the result of attribute resolution returns  
two values but both values are same. Thus, it should not throw ambiguous error.

Before the fix, attributes matched were:

Thus, it throws ambiguous reference error. But if we consider only unique matches, it will return correct result.

In the physical plan, both id and ID columns are projected to the same column in the dataframe: _1#6
_1#6 AS id#17,  _1#6 AS ID#17
So, there is no ambiguity,

Also, in the matched attributes, results are same: attributes: Vector(id#17, id#17)
Just because, we have duplicates in the matched result, it's being considered as ambiguous.

If the matched attribute result was Vector(id#17, ID#17) , then it would have been valid error.

And even if the dataset has columns in different cases, Spark being case insensitive by default, should consider both columns as same.

At the dataset definition phase, especially for intermediate datasets, Spark is lenient/lazy with case sensitivity. This is because the checks happen in SQL Analyzing, which is not required for defining a Dataset. This gives the user more freedom but also cognitive disorders. On the other hand, in the read phase, SQL Analyzing is a mandatory step, and checks will be performed, so the configuration provided by Spark at this stage is sufficient to resolve all ambiguities.","1,-1    ",1,-1,0

yes. It works because the resolved column has just one match 
attributes: Vector(id#17)

but for second case, the match result is
attributes: Vector(id#17, id#17)
Since, there are more than one value although both are exactly same, it fails. This fix proposes to fix this by taking distinct values of match result.

The original idea of driver sort is to avoid one shuffle. Requires SinglePartition seems does not help since it still requires a shuffle.

Besides, finally, the result would go to driver, i.e. `df.sort.collect` (It's the reason I match `ReturnAnswer`), so it should be fine to do at driver. Plus, do sort at driver is not the first code place except driver sort. e.g., the merge function of rdd.takeOrdered. It should be safe if the size of plan is small enough.

The idea of Convert Global SortExec to Local SortExec and make SortExec requires SinglePartition looks fine that It can avoid the `sample` of range partitioner. But it seems orthogonal with this pr.","1,-1    ",1,-1,0

not sure whether it is the correct way to support `ScalarSubquery` in DataFrame APIs, but it is actually a pain point to me.

However, seemingly `InferFiltersFromConstraints` has a dedicated place in the optimizer and so there are 2 special batches `Operator Optimization before Inferring Filters` and `Operator Optimization after Inferring Filters` before and after the rule to make sure the inferred filtes are optimized. It also seems like the `RewriteSubquery` batch slowly becomes larger and larger with rules from those batches (see SPARK-39511, SPARK-22662, SPARK-36280). And now you want to add `InferFiltersFromConstraints` too.

It does seem moving `RewritePredicateSubquery` rule is right way so that in future we don't add anymore rule to that batch (`RewriteSubquery`).

In this pr https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17520, they tried to put RewritePredicateSubquery right after `Subquery` batch (of `OptimizeSubqueries`). `operatorOptimizationBatch` will run after this.  They also added one rule to push LeftSemi/LeftAnti through join, but that has been added in 3.0 by [SPARK-19712](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19712).

The following features from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24553 are not in this PR currently to keep the change simple, but we can add them if needed:
- Extend propagation from attribute => constant mapping to deterministic expression => constant mapping:
  e.g. `abs(a) = 5 AND b = abs(a) + 3` => `abs(a) = 5 AND b = 8`
- Allow substitution in other than `BinaryComparison`s:
  e.g. `a = 5 AND abs(a) = 1` => `a = 5 AND abs(5) = 1`
- Allow propagation of constant non-nullable expressions in `Project` and other nodes:
  e.g. `SELECT a = 5 AND b = a + 3` => `SELECT a = 5 AND b = 8`
  (Currently only `Filter` is supported.)
- Allows deep constant propagation:
  e.g. `WHERE IF(..., a = 5 AND b = a + 3, ...)` => `WHERE IF(..., a = 5 AND b = 8, ...)`
  (Currently only top level `And`/`Or`/`Not` are supported.)

We may need other ways to ensure the correctness of maven shaded server jar.

In the future, we may use sbt to completely replace maven(should not be in Spark 3.4.0), including version release, deploy and other help tools, which will no longer be a problem at that time.

By the way, I think this issue has a pretty high priority since the default nullability of a schema is `False`.

```python
>>> sdf = spark.range(10).schema
self._schema: StructType([StructField('id', LongType(), False)])
```

For example, even intuitive and simple code like creating a DataFrame from a pandas DataFrame fails as follows:
```python
>>> sdf = spark.range(10)
>>> pdf = sdf.toPandas()
>>> spark.createDataFrame(pdf, sdf.schema)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
pyspark.errors.exceptions.connect.AnalysisException: [NULLABLE_COLUMN_OR_FIELD] Column or field `id` is nullable while it's required to be non-nullable.

I found the reason. Although the scala API use analyzer too. `object ResolveLambdaVariables extends Rule[LogicalPlan]` can't fix the issue.

If I removed the` UnresolvedNamedLambdaVariable.freshVarName(...)`

We can discuss this more and invite more SQL experts. Shall we exclude it from this PR for now?

@cloud-fan The prepended underscore is _NOT_ primarily intended as a user surface. Rather, it's a reliale way to get a unique column name that's still at least somewhat readable if you look at the query plan (unlike e.g. a uuid). The new `Dataset.metadataColumn` method does not even _look_ at a renamed attribute's name, for example.

I updated the PR description to not mention the specific renaming mechanism, and to indicate that a SQL user surface is out of scope.

At this point, the only remaining reference to prepended underscores is the two unit tests (""metadata name conflict resolved with leading underscores""), which validate that the renaming reliably produces unique names as intended. If you don't think the test coverage is important, we could remove even that?","1,-1    ",1,-1,0

Hi @mridulm , thanks for the work and it really simplifies the usage of Apache Celeborn (and other similar systems)! This patch looks good to me.

I totally agree with @pan3793 that in hybrid deployed environment, it'll benefit if locality can be exploited, and it's among future works of Apache Celeborn.

There is some gaps. If we store data in the DFS or in disaggregated shuffle cluster. We should return `Nil` in the  `ShuffledRowRDD#getPreferredLocations`. For `CoalescedPartitionSpec`,  `spark.shuffle.reduceLocality.enabled` will help solve this problem. For `PartialReducerPartitionSpec`, `PartialMapperPartitionSpec` and `CoalescedMapperPartitionSpec `,  `spark.shuffle.reduceLocality.enabled`  can't help us. Because we call the method `MapOutpuTracker#getMapLocation`.
Could we modify this method in this pr like?
```
  def getMapLocation(
      dep: ShuffleDependency[_, _, _],
      startMapIndex: Int,
      endMapIndex: Int): Seq[String] =
  {
    val shuffleStatus = shuffleStatuses.get(dep.shuffleId).orNull
    if (shuffleStatus != null || shuffleLocalityEnabled) {
      shuffleStatus.withMapStatuses { statuses =>
        if (startMapIndex < endMapIndex &&
          (startMapIndex >= 0 && endMapIndex <= statuses.length)) {
          val statusesPicked = statuses.slice(startMapIndex, endMapIndex).filter(_ != null)
          statusesPicked.map(_.location.host).toSeq
        } else {
          Nil
        }

```


This job failed, but with call `sparkContext.stop()`, client side failed but in AM it shows SUCCESS
In spark-3.1.2 the code like this
```
    try {
      app.start(childArgs.toArray, sparkConf)
    } catch {
      case t: Throwable =>
        throw findCause(t)
    } finally {
      if (!isShell(args.primaryResource) && !isSqlShell(args.mainClass) &&
        !isThriftServer(args.mainClass)) {
        try {
          SparkContext.getActive.foreach(_.stop())
        } catch {
          case e: Throwable => logError(s""Failed to close SparkContext: $e"")
        }
      }
    }
```

So here for normal job, I think we should pass the exit code to SchedulerBackend, right?


Then after your mention, I see that https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33403 change the behavior that only k8s call `sc.stop()`, then I think for k8s and yarn mode we booth need to pass the exit code the backend.

After this pr, we also need to check if k8s backend exit code is same as client side in client mode too.

- The second commit of SPARK-34674 excludes all `Shell` and `STS` environments to avoid the UT failures.

Three months later after merging the second commit, there was a post-commit review.

@HyukjinKwon I am OK with that, though there is a bigger issue here. We have `TypeVars` in `py` modules in quite a few places, which are a side effect of migrating to inline hints before dropping Python 3.8 support (looking at you, `Protocol`...). 

Ideally, we'd handle all of that consistently and use consistent naming convention, but that's not something will be able to do any time soon.

The approach in this PR only handles the cleanup on driver side. It won't clean up the files if files were uploaded during job submission but then submission fails due to some reason. As in this driver won't be launched and clean up will not happen. 

This Jira SPARK-42744 is duplicate of SPARK-42466. I had already created PR for this issue which handles cleanup on both driver as well client side in case of app submission failure. 
Other than this it also optimises the file upload by creating just one upload sub directory rather than created several sub - directories for each file getting uploaded.

Oh ok, then we see the right fix a bit differently then.
But I'm not entirelly sure I get 2. We can make `aliasMap` immutable, by just adding a `.toMap` to here: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/plans/AliasAwareOutputExpression.scala#L61. But what do you mean by

I'm not sure how AQE context stageCache map would help. The issue in EXPLAIN is that the ReusedExchange.child references a Exchange node that is not referenced anywhere else in the plan tree so we need to generate IDs on the subtree rooted at ReusedExchange.child and print them out. To do this, we need a way to check whether the ReusedExchange.child is referenced anywhere else - if they are not referenced anywhere else, we need to recursively generate IDs for subtree. I keep a HashSet of nodes with IDs already generated and check ReusedExchange.child against it to see if we need to recursively generate IDs on the subtree. ","1,-1    ",1,-1,0

I still have some high-level questions:
1. Does `ReusedSubquery` have the same issue?
2. what if there are more than one `ReusedExchange`s that references non-existing exchange?

I have a new idea that we still display `ReusedExchange` as it is, but we add a new section to display non-existing `Exchanges`:
```
==== Adaptively Optimized Out Exchanges ====
(132) Exchange
Input [3]: [sr_customer_sk#217, sr_store_sk#221, sum#327L]
Arguments: hashpartitioning(sr_store_sk#221, 200), ENSURE_REQUIREMENTS, [plan_id=1791]
```

Then there is no duplication even if more than one `ReusedExchange` reference it.","1,-1    ",1,-1,0
1468621742,83618776,2023/3/15,v3.4.0-rc4,"@cloud-fan Thanks for the idea and response!

1. I don't think this issue doesn't affects `ReusedSubquery` because of how its processed and printed. The current algorithm finds all Subquery nodes (including `ReusedSubquery`) and for each Subquery, it traverses the Subquery subtree to generate the IDs if they are missing. 
Furthermore, a `ReusedSubquery` does not print the details of the Subquery it reuses whereas for ReusedExchange it does print the Exchange ID being reused. For a `ReusedSubquery`, all that is printed is this line:
```Subquery:5 Hosting operator id = 50 Hosting Expression = ReusedSubquery Subquery scalar-subquery#31, [id=#32]```
`Hosting operator ID` is the parent operator that contains the `ReusedSubquery`. The subtree of the `ReusedSubquery` is not printed anywhere and the `ReusedSubquery` node itself is not printed in the main plan tree either. Even if there are non-existing children, the issue is not surfaced in the Explain plan by default.
I guess there's still a chance it might affect Spark UI whereby the IDs in the subtree of a `ReusedSubquery` are incorrect because the IDs were generated in a previous AQE iteration... I'm not sure. I think it's best to wait and see if a ticket/bug like this is ever reported. 

2. My fix detects all the ReusedExchanges with non-existing children and generate IDs on them. I guess your question is what if multiple `ReusedExchange` reference the same non-existing `Exchange`? That's a good point and I need to account for that edge case in the code in case that is possible.

With regards to your idea for a section of non-existing `Exchanges`: we already only print each operator exactly once in the node details section. As shown in the PR description: I currently print out the plan subtree of the Non-Existing Exchange below the `ReusedExchange` (since that subtree is not shown anywhere else) and the node details while maintaining uniqueness.","1,-1    ",1,-1,0

Considering`PYSPARK_NO_NAMESPACE_SHARE` is not a heavily-used user-facing env variable, shall we merge the change proposed in this PR first for clarity? Otherwise, I am afraid that users think pandas_udf is not supported in Connect. I will work on a follow-up to support `sql.connect.functions.pandas_udf` with `PYSPARK_NO_NAMESPACE_SHARE` support.

As for `E.g, could you add a test in test_connect_function?`

The unit tests for pandas_udf are in `python/pyspark/sql/tests/connect/test_parity_pandas_udf.py` if that's your concern.

`sql.functions.pandas_udf` and `sql.connect.functions.pandas_udf` should be usable separately, for vanilla PySpark and Spark Connect, respectively, if `PYSPARK_NO_NAMESPACE_SHARE` is set.

- This PR aims to add `SPARK_DRIVER_POD_IP` to `Executor Pod` in order to help **internal communications between Spark executors and Spark driver**.

I saw this default value, you can do local test with writing following code

The default value `client` you mean, will be set in `prepareSubmitEnvironment` function, which be called in `runMain()` after check 
```

This may be a bit of a regression, maybe...  first, golden generation and validation are done with `hiveResultString `, it won't have what problem, then, the output is more readable, finally, `ThriftServerQueryTestSuite` test case generation also uses the independent `hiveString`, this also needs to reconstruct.

And remove the use of hiveResultString by non-HiveComparisonTest. Like ExpressionInfoSuite, currently, only SQLQueryTestHelper and HiveComparisonTest use hiveResultString, and SQLQueryTestHelper is used for golden file generation. I try to make SQLQueryTestHelper also use sparkResultString, but ThriftServerQueryTestSuite also uses golden files.

And Beautify the output of cast StructType to StringType, Such as {1, 2} -> {a:1, b:2}.  (It has nothing to do with the theme of this PR, Just in passing when making ExpressionInfoSuite to use sparkResultString, If you mind, I can send another PR to do this).","4,-1    ",4,-1,3

@HyukjinKwon @bjornjorgensen @panbingkun In addition to the issues @bjornjorgensen  mentioned, when compiling using Java 8+Scala 2.13, I saw compilation errors as shown in the figure: `[ERROR] -release is only supported on Java 9 and higher
`, It seems that 4.8.1 and Java 8 are not compatible well, although it does not cause compilation failures


More, I saw https://github.com/davidB/scala-maven-plugin/issues/686, So I think we should revert this pr @HyukjinKwon

I think you are right that `EquivalentExpressions.addExpr()` should be guarded by `supportedExpression()` if we guard `getExprState()`. But, I'm not sure it is right that we don't deduplicate the `max(transform(array(id), x -> x))` in your example query.
Probably the real issue here is that in `PhysicalAggregation` the class `EquivalentExpressions` is used for simply deduplicating whole expressions while on executors we use it for common subexpression elimination. In the former case we don't need the `LambdaVariable` guard but in the latter one we need it. So maybe we should add a argument to `EquivalentExpressions` to enable/disable the guards and in `PhysicalAggregation` we should disable it?","1,-1    ",1,-1,0

If I understand right, it effectively eliminates all subexpression elimination involving any expressions containing higher-order functions at any nested level, even though it's perfectly valid to pull out a complete high-order function, you just can't pull out the `LambdaFunction` by itself. 

Currently the check for `CodegenFallback` is what prevents the `LambdaFunction`'s from being considered for subexpression elimination. Quick plug for my 1.5 year old PR for adding codegen to HOFs https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34558 simply adds `HigherOrderFunction` as a special case to only consider the arguments and not the functions themselves for subexpression elimination","1,-1    ",1,-1,0

I think that PR should be reverted.
Update: I've filed a revert PR here: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40475


But I feel that is orthogonal to the issue that we use `EquivalentExpressions` for different purposes in `PhysicalAggregation` (the only place where we use `.addExpr()`) and in executors (`.addExprTree()` for subexpression elimination).

1477131544,107834,2023/3/25,v3.4.0-rc4,"Before the recent rounds of changes to EquivalentExpressions, the old `addExprTree` used to call `addExpr` in its core:
https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-2.1/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/EquivalentExpressions.scala#L90
That was still the case when `PhysicalAggregation` started using this mechanism to deduplicate expressions. I guess it started becoming ""detached"" from the main path when the recent refactoring happened that allows updating a separate equivalence map instead of the ""main"" one.

Your proposed PR here further orphans that function from any actual use. Which is okay for keeping binary compatibility as much as possible.
The inlined dedup logic in `PhysicalAggregation` looks rather ugly though. I don't have a strong opinion about that as long as other reviewers are okay. I'd prefer still retaining some sort of encapsulated collection for the dedup usage.

BTW I updated my PR's test case because it makes more sense to check the return value from `addExpr` on the second invocation rather than on the first (both ""not supported expression"" and actual new expression cases would have gotten a `false` return value if we add that guard to the `addExpr()` function).

- add some Unit Tests for the propose changes (I'll try to do that this week)
- check if the configmap for the driver should also be generated dynamically (I was not able to determine it, on our scenario it does not seem to produce any error)

As far as I am concerned ammonite is just a way to use the connect JVM client, it is not meant as a change for all of Spark (although I do think it might make sense). We use other libraries all the time, and I don't think we have ever discussed those in the mailing list.

As it stands there are two reasons for using ammonite:
- It is a better and easier to use REPL than the Scala REPL ever was.
- It is easier to customize. Connect is a good illustration, for the Scala REPL I will probably need to the same thing as we did for the spark REPL project and that is fork the source code. In ammonite this was a minor modification.

I do intent to add support for the regular REPL at some point, this was just easier to get started with.

1501047078,44108233,2023/3/29,v3.4.0-rc4,"Thank you for the feedback, @bjornjorgensen !

IMHO, it seems more reasonable to add `grpcio` as a dependency for the Pandas API on Spark instead of reverting all this change back (Oh, btw seems like you already open a https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40716 for fixing the existing issue 😄)

From my understanding, the purpose of Spark Connect is to allow users to use existing PySpark project without any code changes through a remote client. Therefore, if a user is using the `pyspark.pandas` module in their existing code, it should work the same way through the remote client as well.

So I think we should support all the functionality of PySpark as much as possible including pandas API on Spark, since nobody can not sure whether existing PySpark users will use the Pandas API on Spark through Spark Connect or not at this point, not only the existing pandas users.

Alternatively, we might be able to create completely separate package path for the Pandas API on Spark for Spark Connect. This would allow the existing Pandas API on Spark to be used without installing `grpcio`, but IMHO it would be much more overhead than simply changing the policy to add one package as an additional installation.

It's not super hard. But it's a bit odd to add this alone to pandas API on Spark. We should probably think about adding grpcio as a hard dependency for whole PySpark project, but definitely not alone for pandas API on Spark.

> What are we achieving with this? GRPC is a stable protocol and not a random library. It's available throughout all platforms.

So for the current status, we're trying to add the dependencies that the module need so users won't need to install the unnecessary dependency. In addition, adding the dependency breaks existing applications when they migrate from 3.4 to 3.5. It matters when PySpark is installed without `pip` (which is actually the official release channel of Apache Spark).

I think this point is particularly crucial even though all of your opinions make sense to me.
To summarize, I will made a fix following the suggestion in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40525#issuecomment-1501097772 so that the Pandas API on Spark can work without `grpcio` for now.

In my local env, I can only repro this by decreasing the driver memory (e.g. ""spark.driver.memory"", ""512M""), And this issue can be simply resolve by increase the driver memory to 1024M.
I tests different combinations locally like:
`spark.driver.memory=1024M, spark.executor.memory=512M`
`spark.driver.memory=1024M, spark.executor.memory=1024M`
etc
and they also works as expected.

But in Github Action (this resource limitation seems to be https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/0b45a5278026c2ea9ce2b127333514f7a7a933f4/.github/workflows/build_and_test.yml#L1028), no matter how larger driver memory I set (3G, 4G), this test just keeps failing with this error message.

>more in favor of an aggregate function that merges sketches and returns the merged sketch

I'm not opposed to building out an agg function that merges sketches without estimating the cardinality; I think this would be beneficial for multi-stage re-aggregations. I think this topic (unfortunately) begs the question of function naming, and here's the resultant naming scheme I'd propose:

Aggregate functions:
- HllSketch (IntegerType|LongType|StringType|...) -> BinaryType
- HllUnion (BinaryType) -> BinaryType

Normal functions
- HllSketchEstimate (BinaryType) -> LongType

I think this API is simple and the lack of an aggregate function that returns the estimated cardinality is fine. What do you think?","1,-1    ",1,-1,0

Semantically I like this API. There is one more scalar expression that I would add, it's purpose being to merge two sketches. Let me give some more details below.

In terms of naming I am more in favor of dropping the ""Sketch"" part from the names and using an underscore to separate the ""Hll"" part from the rest. More specifically this is what I would choose (this is a personal opinion, and I am not reflecting opinions of anybody else other than myself):

Aggregate functions:

* hll_collect (IntegerType|LongType|StringType|BinaryType|...) -> BinaryType
* {hll_merge_agg, hll_union_agg}(BinaryType) -> BinaryType

Scalar functions:
* {hll_merge, hll_union}(BinaryType, BinaryType) -> BinaryType
* hll_estimate(BinaryType) -> LongType

Above I propose hll_merge* or hll_union* for the functions that perform the union (or merge operation) on sketches. I have a slight preference for the ""merge"" versions.","1,-1    ",1,-1,0
1509053727,17288675,2023/4/7,v3.4.0,"Hello @mkaravel ! 

I've updated the PR to provide the following functions:

Aggregate functions:
- hll_sketch_agg(IntegerType|LongType|StringType|BinaryType) -> BinaryType
- hll_union_agg(BinaryType) -> BinaryType

Scalar functions
- hll_sketch_estimate(BinaryType) -> LongType
- hll_union(BinaryType, BinaryType) -> BinaryType

Naming wise, I felt it was valuable to keep the function names aligned with the Datasketches objects they utilize, and be explicit about the operation being applied. Hopefully these function names are a good middle ground for us? I'll continue working on getting all the tests to pass, and then open the PR up for wide review.

I am not questioning the correctness of the DataSketches implementation.

My concern is accidental mistakes that can happen if the user does not pay attention to the `lgk` values of the input sketches. I would argue that merging two sketches with different `lgk` values is ""advanced"" usage of sketches, and the user should be aware that mixing such sketches comes with caveats (loosing precision with respect to the sketch with higher `lgk`). The current API hides this complexity and caveats.

Let's consider another alternative (I want your opinion on this): Let's say we have two overloads (we can extend this to the aggregate version)
* hll_merge(sketch1: BinaryType, sketch2: BinaryType)
* hll_merge(sketch1: BinaryType, sketch2: BinaryType, allowDifferentLgKs: BooleanType)

The first errors out if the `lgk` values are different.
The second errors out if the `lgk` values are different and `allowDifferentLgKs` is `false`. However, if `allowDifferentLgk` is `true` then the second overload behaves as your current implementation.

Clearly, I am talking about adding a third boolean argument, with the default value being `false`. With these two overloads, if the user tries to merge two sketches with different precision, the query will fail. If they really need to merge them, they have the opportunity to do that by means of  setting the third argument to `true`, and it will not happen accidentally without them noticing. It will happen because they force it this way, they will be proactive about the loss of precision. A nice error message for the first overload and good documentation will make it very clear what is going on.","2,-1    ",2,-1,1
1520502797,17288675,2023/4/7,v3.4.0,">about adding a third boolean argument, with the default value being false

I'm open to making this change, as this is in-line with the limitation I was planning on imposing on the original approx_count_distinct_sketch merge functionality. @mkaravel do you have an opinion on whether we should preserve the lgMaxK argument supported by the union operation, given this change?

1. hadoop conf is not that small
2. if the executor is powerful like 16 cores, the hadoop conf has 16 copies in the executor JVM, which is a waste.

Essentially, what I am trying to get to is, having users explicitly try to reason about whether their broadcast data is small or large is brittle - this is something that needs to be handled automatically by the broadcast impl seemlessly.
When data is small, use more efficient paths, and progressively move to more expensive options when data is larger - without any user code change.","1,-1    ",1,-1,0

I think it is a much more sensible default, especially given a) Spark jobs submitted to YARN would usually run longer than a minute including the overhead of launching Spark driver b) We always report any state change immediately e.g. `ACCEPTED` -> `RUNNING`.

@tgravescs The new property allows for the ability to reduce the log noise without reducing the responsiveness when something changes because the status check interval is not reduced like if `spark.yarn.report.interval` was used alone. For example, if a job failed right away waiting 30 seconds to get that feedback slows down the iteration cycle.","1,-1    ",1,-1,0

@tgravescs this property dictates the how often we poll yarn for an application report. We still want to check for the application state every second, if we change this property then we might not know of a change in state until the `x` seconds have elapsed. 

This is why, I decided to create a new logging specific property so that the current behavior of polling application report every second is not affected.

@dongjoon-hyun Can you elaborate about how timezone affects the computed driver pod pending time.

@dongjoon-hyun sorry for response late. 

If I did not misunderstand, you are talking about user changes system time by intention.

Speaking from my limited experience, I think very few users may encounter this case. 
We'd better not to handle this case in Spark's code. 

Besides, if user changed system time by intention, he can handle it by himself easily:
1. Inject a custom spark property, such as `spark.app.systemTimeBias` into SparkConf. 
2. The accurate driver pod pending time would be: `startTime - systemTimeBias - submitTime`.

@LuciferYang this is a good question.  As far as I know, Cascade Lake currently used by most users. Compared with Ice lake, Cascade Lake is Intel's previous generation CPU and it does not contains avx512vbmi & avx512_vbmi2 instruction set.  If running the parquet vector optimization on Cascade Lake, it will become very slowly(0.01x), but there is a JDK [Patch](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8290322) to fix this problem, with the patch, it will be 1.7x.  Under normal situation, it will be 5.5x on Ice Lake with Java17. The patch has been merged Java17.","1,-1    ",1,-1,0

Sorry, I haven't got time to fully review the PR (maybe next week) but at first sight it seems to copy some fuctions (e.g. `checkIdenticalPlans()`, `mergeNamedExpressions()`) from `MergeScalarSubqueries` so there seems to be some room for improvement and we could share the common functions. Also, some names (e.g. `subqueryIndex`) might need some changes here.

This PR combines UNION ALL legs if they return disjoint set of rows from the same source node. I think this makes sense in those cases when there are overlaping scans in the legs (despite the disjoint filters), and by ""overlapping"" I mean that the scans use some common set of files.
So seems like the only case when this change doesn't bring improvement is when the filter is a pushed-down partitioning/bucketing column filter and the scans in union legs doesn't overlap. But even in that case I'm not sure if this PR has any disadvantage, just doesn't improve anything...

BTW, `MergeScalarSubqueries` (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32298) does very similar merging, but we run that only once because merging can be costly when there are many candidates. Do we need `EliminateUnions` in `operatorOptimizationBatch`?
Sidenote: `MergeScalarSubqueries` doesn't work with different filters currently. This is because merging filters in subqueries is more comlicated as we need to propogate the filters up to an aggregate, and because it can cause performance degradation when we have non-overlapping scans. (See this WIP PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37630).","1,-1    ",1,-1,0

Thanks for looking in to that closer. Should probably formulated myself more clearly that was only a guess on my part and not something I had verified. But now that you narrowed it down to 2.13.7 another possible candidate change could be https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9786 that changed how that mutations are tracked in ArrayBuffer. 

EDIT: Even if [scala/scala#9258](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9258) was tagged milestone 2.13.4 at some point it looks to me like it actually landed in 2.13.7 with this commit https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/5f250021e7e55dd36e45d0b224a6cb6967e67ebd

1498310261,1591700,2023/4/11,v3.2.4,"This makes sense.
The TaskRunner is visible to heartbeater since it gets added to `runningTasks` before the task binary is deserialized.
During `TaskRunner.run`, we are registering the accumulators as part of the deserialization - which can result in race with the heartbearter reading the metrics.

So this is essentially a bug waiting to happen for two reasons:

* `externalAccums` is getting used in an MT-unsafe way by the task thread and the reporter thread.
* This is broken in 2.12 as well - we were just not aware of it.
  * There always was potential visibility issues in heartbeat for external accumulators.

Note, the task itself is visible only after the deserialization is complete, since it is volatile - but the registration is not covered by it.

Is it possible to move the changes to ArrowUtils to fix them all?

Yes, I'm aware of the issue, but let me hold on it to the following PRs.
(Thanks for filing the ticket, btw. 😄 )

TL;DR

Actually this PR still has an issue with `toPandas`.

```py
>>> spark.sql(""values (1, struct(1 as a, 2 as a)) as t(x, y)"").toPandas()
   x                     y
0  1  {'a_0': 1, 'a_1': 2}
```

The duplicated fields have suffix `_1`, `_2`, and so on.

Also, handling struct type in `toPandas` was not well-defined and there are behavior difference even between Arrow enabled/disabled in PySpark.

```py
>>> spark.conf.set('spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.enabled', False)
>>> spark.sql(""values (1, struct(1 as a, 2 as b)) as t(x, y)"").toPandas()
   x       y
0  1  (1, 2)
>>> spark.conf.set('spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.enabled', True)
>>> spark.sql(""values (1, struct(1 as a, 2 as b)) as t(x, y)"").toPandas()
   x                 y
0  1  {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
```

Currently PySpark with Arrow enabled, and Spark Connect, use a map for the struct type object as a result, whereas `Row` object in PySpark without Arrow.

The options are:

1. It's ok to be different, also with suffix.
    - In this case, the suffix is a must because a map object will hold only one value for the duplicates.
2. `Row` object should be used for the struct.
    - In this case, we will lose the benefit of Arrow -> pandas fast conversion.","1,-1    ",1,-1,0

Let me clarify it,

TorchDistributer has ""local mode"" configure, if true, it just run torch program in client side, if False, it launches a spark job to run the torch program. So the TorchDistributer side ""local mode"" has nothing to do with spark master local mode.


> why would you not support it on the client?

I assume you mean to run torch program in spark connect client machine, we can support this, but I think it is less meaningful, because client machine should usually run lightweight workloads, but torch programs are heavy workloads and they often requires GPU, which client machine are hard to satisfy the condition.

I don't think this is a valid assumption. With Spark Connect you can actually build an environment in which you have GPU locally but don't have a GPU on your cluster. In this case you still want to leverage the same execution flow. I've previously talked to users that were looking for an EC2 setup with a GPU attached and running the workloads from there against Sprk using Spark Connect. 

This is very similar to running sklearn locally on the client side.

On a broader side of things: It would be good to clarify why spark-sql shell is expected to be visually compatible with spark-shell, those are two different REPLs with their own ways of displaying data. For example, we don't display a table the same way in those REPLs.","1,-1    ",1,-1,0

That said, any behavior change of that ""string generation"" function will change the value we write to CSV, but I wouldn't call it a CSV behavior change.

It's intentional that the cast struct/array/map to string behavior is changed w.r.t. nulls. If third-party libraries rely on this behavior, then we need to revisit this PR.

Could you provide an example of inconsistency in df.show() that this PR addresses?

The reason I brought the CSV example is because that is typically how users would write structs/arrays/maps to a CSV file, they would transform that to a string, potentially via CAST. That is why I think this is a behaviour change in writing a CSV file.","1,-1    ",1,-1,0

Actually, previously, the top-level is consistent with the inner null display with `null`. This PR mainly thinks that the mainstream database uses `NULL` instead of `null` when displaying null, and `NULL` is a better nice string representation.

If it's affecting something else, I think we should look at it again, sorry ~ : )


> For example, we don't display a table the same way in those REPLs.

I can see making spark-sql shell consistent with Presto/Trino/MySQL/Postgres, etc. but I don't understand why Scala REPL should be visually consistent with SQL terminal in terms of displaying results - they serve different purposes.

If you would like to have a consistent visual behaviour for NULLs/nulls, it is also fine just as long as it does not break other features like Cast or `collect.toString`. Maybe we could simply add a conversion method to display values in a DataFrame in whatever format we need when calling `.show` instead of changing Cast. In fact, we can refactor it into a separate class and reuse it in spark-sql and spark-shell.

But there’s a shortcoming that it is low performant for sparse vector features. We haven’t made final decision yet.

Finally, after offline discussion, we decided to adopt the approach of this PR, because this PR approach has significant benefits including:

 - It does not need to dump training dataset to distributed file system but just saving partition data in local disk, which is much faster.
 - If we uses petastorm or pytorch parquet / arrow loader, we have to densify sparse feature input data, it makes data exploded before saving dataset, this causes further performance deterioration. But current approach in this PR it dumps sparse data to local disk and when loading for training, it densifies the data.

Btw, we decided to make it a private API because the API currently will be only used by pyspark MLv2 (a new module we plan to add soon) code.

In prod, we have seen 20~50 percent resource save based on executor size, the more saving with more cpu cores per executor. For the issue could be caused by bin-packed executors, it's still possible to happen when all executor cores are occupied. If it indeed happen, the better solution might be large partition num.

It`s about container memory request&limit, not about the driver or exec.
Current code is setting the pod request.memory and limit.memory in the **same value** from by summing the values of spark.{driver,executor}.memory and spark.{driver,executor}.memoryOverhead.
But request.memory and limit.memory are different kind of params from k8s, always keep same value may not a good practice. In most case the request memory quota we can get is always smaller than limit.memory from infrastructure team. If spark pods request.memory can only same as limit.memory, then total memory we can use is based on the smaller one, thus can not fully use the memory resource.

I see. With additional look I think here it's better to keep what it is. as Status's description is nullable:

``` 
private Status(Code code, @Nullable String description, @Nullable Throwable cause) {
    this.code = checkNotNull(code, ""code"");
    this.description = description;
    this.cause = cause;
  }

public Status withDescription(String description) {
    if (Objects.equal(this.description, description)) {
      return this;
    }
    return new Status(this.code, description, this.cause);
  }

The challenge with this approach is that `InMemoryRelation` does not get the physical plan passed in directly. It is through `CachedRDDBuilder`. I originally tried making a new `CachedRDDBuilder` with a copy of the physical plan, but it broke other tests due to the private state it maintains.","2,-3    ",2,-3,-1

@cloud-fan Cloning the cachedPlan is also problematic because it contains state (accumulators in private fields) when it includes a `CollectMetricsExec` operator. `CollectMetricsExec.collect` specifically looks at the `InMemoryRelation.cachedPlan` to get the stateful metrics.

I verified this is an issue by cloning `InMemoryRelation.cachedPlan`. Then I modified a unit test that uses `Dataset.observe` to cache the dataset. This breaks the unit test. When I revert cloning the cachedPlan it passes. Here is how I modified the unit test to prove the issue.

1. (-0.5) As per docker official recommendation about [USER](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#user), we should use `groupadd` and `useradd` to address, rather than change `/etc/passwd` directly. If we specify the USER (useradd/groupadd) in Dockerfile in future, this change will be ignored.
2. (-0.5) In theory, application users should be decoupled from container users. Such as, spark docker image should use static user `spark` (just like we done in spark-docker), and other application respect the `spark` user, or don’t depends on the container user.
3. (+0.5) As per https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23017 original design, it was intend to switch user name dynamically.
4. (+0.5) Consider the Spark case, there are many users want to migrate YARN to K8s easily, support user dynamic switch is a reasonable case.
5. (+0.5) It's a K8s only feature, not for Docker image, so 1 / 2 could be balanced in some level.

Yes. Since, the secret is not encrypted, it is a security violation for some applications. If the NM goes down, the metadata of these apps will not be recovered but that is acceptable.

It can be done but setting up and running  another shuffle service requires much more effort at least in our production environment.

The code change here is quite small. Agreed that disabling recovery for the whole ESS may need much smaller change but there is not much complexity with this change as well.

2. With the above change�?master can build success with hadoop 3.1.x as following

```
build/mvn clean install -Dhadoop.version=3.1.4 -Dhadoop-client-api.artifact=hadoop-client -Dhadoop-client-runtime.artifact=hadoop-yarn-api -Dhadoop-client-minicluster.artifact=hadoop-client -DskipTests -Pno-shaded-hadoop-client -Pmesos -Pyarn -Pkinesis-asl -Phive-thriftserver -Pspark-ganglia-lgpl -Pkubernetes -Phive

```

Otherwise, cannot build `yarn` module with hadoop 3.1.x.

I test with hadoop 3.2.4. `AbortableStreamBasedCheckpointFileManager` was introduced in SPARK-40039, and it uses APIs that are only available in Hadoop 3.3.1+([HADOOP-16906](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-16906)  `FSDataOutputStream#abort()`)

1516659349,7253827,2023/4/25,v3.2.4,"> @peter-toth can you briefly explain the idea of fixing it?

I've updated the PR recently, but the main change is that the CTE accumulator map argument of `buildCTEMap()` changed from 
`mutable.HashMap.empty[Long, (CTERelationDef, Int)]`
to 
`mutable.SortedMap.empty[Long, (CTERelationDef, Int, mutable.Map[Long, Int])]`.
The new `mutable.Map[Long, Int]` part tracks where the references are pointing to from a CTE. (The old `Int` part tracks the ""count of incoming references"".)

Once we have this extended outer map we can correct the ""count of incoming references"" in `cleanCTEMap()`. We just need to iterate the CTEs in reverse order (that's why the outer map is now a `SortedMap`) and if we encounter a CTE whose ""count of incoming references"" is 0 then we decrease the referenced CTE's ""count of incoming references"".

To build the new inner map `buildCTEMap()` has a new `outerCTEId` optional argument.

The current state is as described by @jchen5  . `select false from ... group by c` will return null on empty inputs, not return `false`. I think this is what @jchen5 worry about. You can check by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40865#discussion_r1173210161 .

If you think `select false from ... group by c` in subquery should return `false` on empty inputs, this PR have bug now. If you think it should return `null` on empty inputs, this PR are correct.

Yes, this should return null on empty data.

I will try to find another test case to check the potential issue I mentioned. Maybe something like `select *, (select false as result from t1 where t0.a = t1.c limit 1) from t0)`(correct answer for that is also null). (This specific case isn't currently supported though)","1,-1    ",1,-1,0

Because the memory address (`InMemoryTable@752725d9`) is different every time it runs. I removed these in the test suite.

It seems to have added 4 constraints, but `MAX_BIGINT_SCALE_MAGNITUDE ` is not configurable.

May be we should add corresponding configurable items to `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.json.JSONOptions` and  inject them in `JSONOptions#buildJsonFactory` by `JsonFactoryBuilder#streamReadConstraints(StreamReadConstraints)`.

This may handle most scenarios, but there are still some places in Spark that call `new ObjectMapper()`, these will using `StreamReadConstraints.defaults()`, but for them, using the default value may be OK(need to analyze it one by one). 

If there is a problem with what I said, please correct me @pjfanning , thanks

Well, upgrading SnakeYAML might work as a temporary solution, but for Spark's long-term benefit, I believe it's best to upgrade Jackson now. This will make future upgrades of Jackson much easier. Additionally, Snyk has opened two PRs to upgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat:jackson-dataformat-yaml` to version 2.15.0. By upgrading Jackson now, we'll address these issues and won't receive any further request about this.","1,-1    ",1,-1,0

Or chatGPT will have this 

Cache frequently used values to reduce the number of map lookups. For example, in the JSONOptions class, you can create lazy vals for the frequently accessed parameters:
```
  lazy val samplingRatio: Double = parameters.get(SAMPLING_RATIO).map(_.toDouble).getOrElse(1.0)
  lazy val primitivesAsString: Boolean = parameters.get(PRIMITIVES_AS_STRING).map(_.toBoolean).getOrElse(false)
  lazy val prefersDecimal: Boolean = parameters.get(PREFERS_DECIMAL).map(_.toBoolean).getOrElse(false)
 ```
In the safeStringToInt method, you can use scala.util.Try to handle the conversion from String to Int:
```
	private def safeStringToInt(value: String, default: Int): Int = {
		scala.util.Try(value.toInt).filter(_ >= 0).getOrElse(default)
	  }
```	  
Consider using getOrElse with a default value directly instead of map followed by getOrElse for some parameters:
```
  private val maxNestingDepth: Int = parameters
    .getOrElse(""maxNestingDepth"", StreamReadConstraints.DEFAULT_MAX_DEPTH.toString)
    .pipe(safeStringToInt(_, StreamReadConstraints.DEFAULT_MAX_DEPTH))

  private val maxNumLen: Int = parameters
    .getOrElse(""maxNumLen"", StreamReadConstraints.DEFAULT_MAX_NUM_LEN.toString)
    .pipe(safeStringToInt(_, StreamReadConstraints.DEFAULT_MAX_NUM_LEN))

  private val maxStringLen: Int = parameters

Spark depends on Avro which depends on Jackson 2.12.7. Projects that depend on Spark transitively depend on Jackson 2.12.7.

Maybe spark-core should depend on Jackson 2.15.0 with runtime scope, rather than compile scope.

So, instead of

We can make it

This is similar to what I tried in my previous attempt: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40884
We need to support parameter markers as well as ""proper"" (session) variables which would not have a leading '$'.
They would just be identifiers which need to be resolved.
Also we need the ability for users to pre-fix and post-fix. For example a schema-name or a field name.
Without solid support for parameter markers (and variables) we are still open to SQL injection.
I was told that I cannot call eval from within the parser.

The general structure of the PR looks OK.

This PR proposes to add new unresolved nodes for several different locations in the parser. This could be useful in the future if we want to add more custom analysis support for these different areas.

Alternatively, we could leave the multipartIdentifier references where they are, and just update its definition instead:

```
multipartIdentifier
    : IDENTIFIER_KW LEFT_PAREN expression RIGHT_PAREN
    | parts+=errorCapturingIdentifier (DOT parts+=errorCapturingIdentifier)*
    ;
```

This would reduce the number of changes to the .g4 file, since the proposed namespaceReference and functionNameReference and relationReference are all the same syntax. Then the PR would be easier to merge into different Spark forks out there. But this approach grants us future flexibility, if we ever anticipate the syntax to diverge for these different cases.

- I am not familiar with DataTables library and have no idea about the changes between the current version and 1.13.2
- The CSS change is very simple, easy to understand, and has a very minimal surface area.  

I will put up a PR for the CSS change but will leave this PR open for a bit longer in case anyone feel strongly for upgrading DataTables to 1.13.2","1,-1    ",1,-1,0

There is more info in the issue on JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-43357

So basically when integrating we glue we are getting issues:

```
org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.api.InvalidObjectException: Unsupported expression '2023 - 05 - 03' (Service: AWSGlue; Status Code: 400; Error Code: InvalidInputException; Request ID: beed68c6-b228-442e-8783-52c25b9d2243; Proxy: null)
```

Now this issue might be on the side of glue, but glue is supposed to be hive compatible. So I think this should also work with a hive catalog. However I do not have access to one, and would net to se one up.
So maybe someone with more experience with that could help me to test compatibility.","1,-1    ",1,-1,0

This is great, thanks @grundprinzip! I copied code from your PR to this PR. Those `make` commands are very convenient!

By the way, we need to discuss where to publish those generated Go proto files. People will need to reference those files as Go module/package, when they write Spark Connect Go application. Any thoughts on this?

I think we probably need to figure out how `go get` will work  as well. Unfortunately, the release distribution will require us to check-in the generated code.

Got it, I am not super familiar with git commands to merge between different PRs, sorry for breaking here. I think now Makefile is good.

There are two possible issue we met before:
1. Github Action flaky issue: https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/32184
2. Permisssion seeting issue. By default, write permission already included to your GITHUB_TOKEN, but if you set it manually (see also [1], [2]), it will failed, current CI will first build infra and push to your ghcr so write permission is required.

The intent of this PR is to change the way `df.show` represents the map data type, which is currently different from some mainstream databases.

SPARK-43329 and SPARK-43342 were filed as a regression at Apache Spark 3.4.0 and those issues have the error message, `IllegalArgumentException: PVC ClaimName: a1pvc should contain OnDemand or SPARK_EXECUTOR_ID when requiring multiple executors`.

I linked all the reported issues to the original JIRA which caused this regression.
- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-39006 Show a directional error message for PVC Dynamic Allocation Failure

And, the following was the reverting PR from the author of SPARK-39006, @dcoliversun.
- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41057


In short, while adding a log message, we missed a corner case which one NFS-backed PVC is mounted by multiple executors. So, we decide to revert SPARK-39006 because it doesn't give actual benefit (except logging).","1,-1    ",1,-1,0

I agree this config is not a perfect solution to solve this issue of migration competing with shuffle fetch. But it provides a feasible workaround to limit the impact of data migration. In our prod, using `maxRatio` of 0.3 could have similar perf as without shuffle migration while `maxRatio` of 0.5 or large has significant perf regression.","1,-1    ",1,-1,0

I have seen 2 cases when target executor has busy shuffle fetch and upload due to shuffle migration:
1. All Netty request handler threads are exhausted, it'll throw `TimeoutException` when creating connection to target executor took longer than `connectTimeout`.
2. `IdleStateHandler` will close connection when fetch request took longer than `requestTimeout` to receive response.

Case 2 can't be handled by existing config, there'll be other similar recoverable cases. Generally speaking, I think unregister all map output when fetch failed is too aggressive. So it's better to have config to control or disable such behavior. If the executor is really dead, the map output will be unregistered 
when removing executor, if executor is just experiencing temporary and recoverable hiccup, then unregister is too expensive.","1,-1    ",1,-1,0

Did you try increasing idle timeout ?
The behavior is specific to the environment application is running in - where executors are unable to respond to shuffle requests for more than 2 minutes: this looks more like a tuning or deployment issue.

> Generally speaking, I think unregister all map output when fetch failed is too aggressive.

As described, this is a case of not appropriately configuring spark for the load/cluster characteristics.
For example, in our internal env, the network timeout is set to a significantly higher value than the default 120s due to a variety of factors - the default 2mins would result in failures (including this specific shuffle issue mentioned).

This proposed change would complicate the way we reason about when shuffle data is lost - and I am not inclined towards it if it is something that can be mitigated with appropriate tuning.","2,-1    ",2,-1,1

      // After new SparkUI is loaded, `activeUIs` contains new SparkUI
      activeUIs.remove((appId, attemptId))
    }
    uiOption.foreach { loadedUI =>
      loadedUI.lock.writeLock().lock()
      try {
        loadedUI.ui.store.close()
      } finally {
        loadedUI.lock.writeLock().unlock()
      }

      diskManager.foreach { dm =>
        // If the UI is not valid, delete its files from disk, if any. This relies on the fact that
        // ApplicationCache will never call this method concurrently with getAppUI() for the same
        // appId / attemptId.
        dm.release(appId, attemptId, delete = !loadedUI.valid)
      }
    }

@steveloughran Thanks for your inputs.

In SparkHistoryServer, SparkUIs are tracked by <appId, attemptId> in many places:
1. `ApplicationCache#appCache`
2. `FsHistoryProvider#activeUIs`
3. `HistoryServerDiskManager#active`
4. Disk-based KVStore backend local path: appStoreDir/\<appId>_\<attemptId>/
5. Disk-based KVStore backend local file lock: appStoreDir/\<appId>_\<attemptId>/LOCK

All the above places assumes there is only one SparkUI loaded for one <appId, attemptId> pair.

Guava LoadingCache can ensure this when SparkUIs are guarded by its locks.
But SparkUI's detaching is not guarded by LoadingCache's lock.  

This PR is aimed to ensure this from SparkUI's loading to detaching.","1,-2    ",1,-2,-1

sorry i didn't get a chance to reply to this until now. There is no information loss, technically, as uint32 is 4 bytes and uint64 is 8 bytes, same as int and long respectively. However, there is overflow in the representation.

Here's an example:

Consider a protobuf message like:
```
syntax = ""proto3"";

message Test {
  uint64 val = 1;
}
```

Generate a protobuf with a value above 2^63. I did this in python with a small script like:

```
import test_pb2

s = test_pb2.Test()
s.val = 9223372036854775809 # 2**63 + 1
serialized = s.SerializeToString()
print(serialized)
```

This generates the binary representation:

```
b'\x08\x81\x80\x80\x80\x80\x80\x80\x80\x80\x01'
```

Then, deserialize this using `from_protobuf`. I did this in a notebook so its easier to see, but could reproduce in a scala test as well:

<img width=""597"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/1002986/a6c58c19-b9d3-44d4-8c2a-605991d3d5de"">


This is exactly what we'd expect when you take a 64 bit number with the highest bit as `1` and then try to interpret it as a signed number (long), it becomes negative.

So this PR proposes some changes to the deserialization behavior. However, I don't know if its right to change the default or have an option to allow unpacking as a larger type.

What if you have a UDF that converts this to BigDecimal? Will you get the value back?
I guess that is the intention behind why protobuf-java casts unsiged to signed in its Java methods. 
I think it simpler to go this way. Given these kinds of issues, I guess it is not a good practice to use unsiged in protobuf. It can be intepreted correctly at application level when they are infact used this way.","2,-1    ",2,-1,1

Yeah, there is no information loss so you can get the right value the way I did in this PR (Integer.toUnsignedLong, Long.toUnsignedString). I think, though, it's useful if the `spark-protobuf` library can do this; the burden of taking a struct and trying to do this transformation is cumbersome, in my opinion.

However, one additional piece of information is that **for unsigned types in parquet, the default behavior is to represent them in larger types**. I put this in the PR description but see this ticket https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-34817 implemented in this PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31921. Or the existing code today https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/parquet/ParquetSchemaConverter.scala#L243-L247 which shows that **by default** parquet unsigned values are actually expanded to larger types in spark.

So, since this same problem/solution exists in another storage format, I think its useful to implement this behavior here as well. I also think that it actually _does_ make sense to do it by default, as parquet already does this. However, i'm open also to doing this transformation behind an option so that no existing usages are broken. Mainly, I want to just make sure we do  what is the most correct and broadly consistent thing to do (and i'm not really sure exactly what that is, and would love some other inputs). cc @HyukjinKwon as well here since you reviewed the original PR doing this for parquet!

Good day. I would like to know whether this pull request to for spark sql query with delta lake delta table v2.
I simply encounter this issue with spark 3.2 (delta lake 1.2) and spark 3.3 (delta lake 2.2), which I think this pull request could help resolve this issue.

The overall performance won't be significantly reduced as we pay the cost in each operation without writebatch (which leads slowdown in benchmark), whereas we are going to pay the cost at once in commit phase when we use writebatch & flush in commit phase. (We benchmarked by ourselves.)

As part of that change, we don't use writeBatch any more and have also moved to disable the write ahead log. As part of this, puts/deletes will be written to memtables and gets will also be served from memtables/block cache which might lead to some difference in perf for those options. We can cover up for most of that since the db write during commit is now eliminated and we can also do periodic flushing with a related upcoming change. That overall portion, I believe is not covered by the b/mark test that we have today.

Could you let me know which b/mark test will fail and how we run that ?

@HeartSaVioR - do you proposing changing the b/mark itself ? or rerunning and updating the results page ?","3,-1    ",3,-1,2

should be. IPC is all based on protobuf and we try not to remove things to avoid breaking existing code. HDFS compatibility across major versions is something which mattersd a lot, I believe webhdfs has the strongest guarantees.

what does break, guaranteed, is mixing hadoop libraries from different versions on the classpath. Avoid that. on and for cloudstuff openssl/wildfly is a source of extreme brittleness, even though when it works it's often faster than JVM ssl

I think the former is probably better: the optimizer can safely convert `levenshtein(s1, s2) < c` into `levenshtein(s1, s2, c) < c`, which I believe should be a quite common use case of `levenshtein`.

Given the executor use `SparkHadoopUtil.get.newConfiguration(conf)` to construct Hadoop conf,  we can put the related hdfs/s3 configurations into `spark-defaults.conf` w/ `spark.hadoop.` prefix as a workaround.

I think it is necessary.

Hadoop and spark are different components, it is better to maintain them separately.

In our company, we have conf version for hadoop conf, so we do not put hadoop config files under SPARK_HOME/conf, we use soft link to manage the hadoop conf.


> Alternatively, if both exist, what is the precedence between them? Is it idempotent?

In this pr, it just mounts the hadoop config map in the executor side(mounts HADOOP_CONF_DIR env) and the hadoop conf mounted is absolute same with that in driver pod.

As shown below, the SPARK_CONF_DIR has higher precedence. I think it is idempotent.

I do not fully agree. In the early days, Hadoop may be special. We have a specific code path to read HADOOP_CONF_DIR. But now Hadoop is an option, as we have other options for storage and scheduling, especially on the cloud or Kubernetes.

I believe different companies treat hadoop conf differently.

For ebay, we add conf version for hadoop conf, because it is used by
- public  hadoop client nodes
- private hadoop client nodes
- hadoop service nodes(nn, rm, hms, kyuubi)
- hadoop slave nodes(nm, dn)

and between different conf versions, there might be incompatibilities.

and we have an RESTful service to download the hdaoop conf and we use soft link to manage them locally.

Recently, we are making spark migration, from spark3 + hadoop2 to spark3 + hadoop3.

For hadoop2 and hadoop3, the hadoop confs are even different.

So to manage the hadoop conf well and due to the current situation,  in ebay, we do not want to put the hadoop conf files and spark conf files together.

Firstly, when it iterates through the first import - `import ammonite.compiler.CodeClassWrapper`, it believes that there are no imports related to group `group.java` and `group.scala` at this time. The logic enters the check of the third group (`group.3rdParty`), and the rule we configured at this time only does not allow starting with `org.apache.spark.`. This condition is met, but it is not what we want.

By adjusting the regular matching rules of `group.3rdParty` group, the above situation can be avoided. We do not allow starting with `javax?.`, `scala.`, or `org.apache.spark.`.

PS: The logic of `org.scalastyle.scalariform.ImportOrderChecker` is as follows:

When the `FileDescritptorSet` size is large enough or many protobuf functions are used, task size would be larger and cause some scheduling overhead. It would be much lightweighter to just carrying the file path name.

To address that problem, we would normally broadcast the byte buffer, however that may not work well with spark connect?

1.When I review the HadoopRDD code, I noticed some inspection prompts, eg:

2.So I wonder if there are other cases in the core module, then I export `unused declaration` rule to single file, name as `unused_declaration.xml`
<img width=""443"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/be2d73d6-a900-4a33-9927-91f9e191703c"">

3.execute command:

4.The declared unused variable results in all `core` modules will be saved in the `unused_declaration_results` file.

5.Open it by IDE.

6.Some inspect results may be inaccurate and ultimately require manual reconfirmation.

Currently, we have only added compilation checks on `-Ywarn-unused:imports` for Scala 2.12 (the behavior of Scala 2.13 is slightly different).

This doesn't unblock [SPARK-36744](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-36744). To be able to read merged data, clients only know the map outputs belonging to that merged blocks. If the map outputs are encrypted, the client will need to know the size as well to decrypt it which is a protocol change.

No, with this modification, we obtain the reference to the `MergedBlockMetaReqHandler` from the `delegate (ExternalBlockHandler)` that the `AuthRpcHandler` is initialized with. The `saslHandler` instance within the `AuthRpcHandler` is specifically created for fallback to SASL, and we should not have used it to retrieve the MergedBlockMetaReqHandler.

This may require adding a status to record whether it is a user-specified slice or use default? Sounds like it will increase the complexity of the code. I don't think it's worth because this just a minor case, maybe keep it as it is is better

I guess we don't need a lower-bound:
1, we don't use a lower-bound in [CI](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/dev/infra/Dockerfile#L68);
2, the `matplotlib` is only used in Pandas API on Spark, and `pandas` already has a [lower-bound](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/requirements-dev.txt#L29) `matplotlib>=3.6.1` for `matplotlib`.","1,-1    ",1,-1,0

In fact, there is a problem with this UT. Its original intention was to test if there is no file with `.avro` extensions in the directory, and the read should fail. However, this UT triggered the error as `FileUtils.touch` instead of `spark.read.format(""avro"").load(dir.toString)`. 

After this PR is completed, I will submit a new PR to fix this issue.

The root cause for the failure of this case is that the parent directory was not created. When FileUtils.touch is called in version 1.11.0, it just throws `java.io.FileNotFoundException`, which covers the error.

Great catch! I used the wrong query tests, updated them now. In both cases the results on the master branch are wrong:
```
select * from (
 select t1.id c1, (
  select t2.id c from range (1, 2) t2
  where t1.id = t2.id  ) c2
 from range (1, 3) t1 ) t
where t.c2 is not null
-- !query schema
struct<c1:bigint,c2:bigint>
-- !query output
1	1
2	NULL

```
and 

```
-- !query
select *
from range(1, 3) t1
where (select t2.id c
       from range (1, 2) t2 where t1.id = t2.id
      ) is not null
-- !query schema
struct<id:bigint>
-- !query output
1
2
```

-- in both queries the second row should not be present.","1,-1    ",1,-1,0

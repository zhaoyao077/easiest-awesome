If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFile-source constant metadata columns are often derived indirectly from file-level metadata values rather than exposing those values directly. Add support for metadata extractors, so that we can express such columns in a generic way.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAllows to express the existing file-source metadata columns in a generic way (previously hard-wired), and also allows to lazily derive expensive metadata values only if the query actually selects them.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test. Plus, existing file-source metadata unit tests pass.",

  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a pull request to port the fix from the master branch to version 3.3. [PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40755)\r\n\r\nWhen doing an outer join with joinWith on DataFrames, unmatched rows return Row objects with null fields instead of a single null value. This is not a expected behavior, and it's a regression introduced in [this commit](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/cd92f25be5a221e0d4618925f7bc9dfd3bb8cb59). This pull request aims to fix the regression, note this is not a full rollback of the commit, do not add back \"schema\" variable.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncase class ClassData(a: String, b: Int)\r\nval left = Seq(ClassData(\"a\", 1), ClassData(\"b\", 2)).toDF\r\nval right = Seq(ClassData(\"x\", 2), ClassData(\"y\", 3)).toDF\r\n\r\nleft.joinWith(right, left(\"b\") === right(\"b\"), \"left_outer\").collect\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nWrong results (current behavior):    Array(([a,1],[null,null]), ([b,2],[x,2]))\r\nCorrect results:                     Array(([a,1],null), ([b,2],[x,2]))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe need to address the regression mentioned above. It results in unexpected behavior changes in the Dataframe joinWith API between versions 2.4.8 and 3.0.0+. This could potentially cause data correctness issues for users who expect the old behavior when using Spark 3.0.0+.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit test (use the same test in previous [closed pull request](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35140), credit to Cl√©ment de Groc) Run sql-core and sql-catalyst submodules locally with ./build/mvn clean package -pl sql/core,sql/catalyst\r\n\r\nCloses #40755 from kings129/encoder_bug_fix.\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: --global <xuqiang129@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

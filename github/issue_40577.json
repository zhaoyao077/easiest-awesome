  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFixed the problem that LDAP authentication cannot be performed correctly when the domain parameter is passed in. For example, Spark Thrift Server will encounter this problem when using Active Directory and passing domain for LDAP authentication.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen the LDAP provider has domain configuration, such as Active Directory, the principal should not be constructed according to the DN pattern, but the user containing the domain should be directly passed to the LDAP provider as the principal.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting test.\r\n",

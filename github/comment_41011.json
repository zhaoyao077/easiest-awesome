However, upon thinking about it more, I am leaning toward minimal CSS change without upgrading DataTables library for the following reason:\r\n- DataTables version upgraded to 1.13.2 is only in master branch and has not been part of any release (i.e. 3.3, 3.4) yet. Making it risky\r\n- I am not familiar with DataTables library and have no idea about the changes between the current version and 1.13.2\r\n- The CSS change is very simple, easy to understand, and has a very minimal surface area.  \r\n\r\nI will put up a PR for the CSS change but will leave this PR open for a bit longer in case anyone feel strongly for upgrading DataTables to 1.13.2",

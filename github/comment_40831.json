    "body": "Just for others reviewer infomation, I also wanna share some considerations about this (also include some idea in offline discussion with @pan3793 ):\r\n1. (-0.5) As per docker official recommendation about [USER](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#user), we should use `groupadd` and `useradd` to address, rather than change `/etc/passwd` directly. If we specify the USER (useradd/groupadd) in Dockerfile in future, this change will be ignored.\r\n2. (-0.5) In theory, application users should be decoupled from container users. Such as, spark docker image should use static user `spark` (just like we done in spark-docker), and other application respect the `spark` user, or don’t depends on the container user.\r\n3. (+0.5) As per https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23017 original design, it was intend to switch user name dynamically.\r\n4. (+0.5) Consider the Spark case, there are many users want to migrate YARN to K8s easily, support user dynamic switch is a reasonable case.\r\n5. (+0.5) It's a K8s only feature, not for Docker image, so 1 / 2 could be balanced in some level.\r\n\r\nSo, I am +0.5 on this PR. : )",

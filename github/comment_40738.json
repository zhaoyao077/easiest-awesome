And feel free to cc me when Spark has the next attempt to use maven 3.9.x/4.x.\r\nI was pessimistic that whether Maven will change the default timeout as it's a default config (`aether.connector.connectTimeout=10000`) of Maven Artifact Resolver not in Maven itself. And as for Maven, it has changed to Artifact Resolver as the default resolver already, which fewer improvements we could expect from that. And we are also difficult to reduce possible timeout to maven central mirrors.",

  "body": "<!--\r\nThanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds server-side artifact management as a follow up to the client-side artifact transfer introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40256.\r\n\r\nNote: The artifacts added on the server are visible to **all users** of the cluster. This is a limitation of the current spark architecture (unisolated classloaders).\r\n\r\nApart from storing generic artifacts, we handle jars and classfiles in specific ways:\r\n\r\n- Jars: \r\n  - Jars may be added but not removed or overwritten.\r\n  - Added jars would be visible to **all** users/tasks/queries.\r\n- Classfiles:\r\n  - Classfiles may not be explicitly removed but are allowed to be overwritten.\r\n  - We piggyback on top of the REPL architecture to serve classfiles to the executors\r\n    -  If a REPL is initialized, classfiles are stored in the existing `spark.repl.class.outputDir` and share the URI with `spark.repl.class.uri`.\r\n    - If a REPL is not being used, we use a custom directory (root: `sparkContext. sparkConnectArtifactDirectory`) to store classfiles and point the `spark.repl.class.uri` towards it.\r\n  - Class files are visible to **all** users/tasks/queries.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40256 implements the client-side transfer of artifacts to the server but currently, the server does not process these requests.\r\n\r\nWe need to implement a server-side management mechanism to handle the storage of these artifacts on the driver as well as perform further processing (such as adding jars and moving class files to the right directories).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, a new experimental API but no behavioural changes.\r\nA new method called `sparkConnectArtifactDirectory` is accessible through SparkContext (the directory storing all artifacts from SparkConnect)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew unit tests.",

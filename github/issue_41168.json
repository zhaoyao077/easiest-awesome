  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. sparkConf's getOption/get supports substitution for raw keys\r\n2. sparkConf's getAllWithPrefix supports substitution for values\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo be consistent between `sparkConf.get(CONFIG_ENTRY_A)` and `sparkConf.get(CONFIG_ENTRY_A.key)`. \r\nIt's also a todo left for: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/18394#discussion_r126241078\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Some values contain env/sys variables, such as `${env:xxx}`, `${sys:yyy}` might be substituted by the real one. \r\nHowever I doubt that's rarely possibel\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new UTs.",

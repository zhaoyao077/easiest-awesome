The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUNRECOGNIZED_SQL_TYPE prints the jdbc type id in the error message currently. This is difficult for spark users to understand the meaning of this kind of error, especially when the type id is from a vendor extension.\r\n\r\nFor example, \r\n\r\n```java\r\n org.apache.spark.SparkSQLException: Unrecognized SQL type -102\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile -102 is nonstandard, it's hard to know what type it is\r\n\r\n```\r\nclassOf[java.sql.JDBCType].getEnumConstants.foreach(t => println(t.getName + \"|\" + t.getVendorTypeNumber))\r\nBIT|-7\r\nTINYINT|-6\r\nSMALLINT|5\r\nINTEGER|4\r\nBIGINT|-5\r\nFLOAT|6\r\nREAL|7\r\nDOUBLE|8\r\nNUMERIC|2\r\nDECIMAL|3\r\nCHAR|1\r\nVARCHAR|12\r\nLONGVARCHAR|-1\r\nDATE|91\r\nTIME|92\r\nTIMESTAMP|93\r\nBINARY|-2\r\nVARBINARY|-3\r\nLONGVARBINARY|-4\r\nNULL|0\r\nOTHER|1111\r\nJAVA_OBJECT|2000\r\nDISTINCT|2001\r\nSTRUCT|2002\r\nARRAY|2003\r\nBLOB|2004\r\nCLOB|2005\r\nREF|2006\r\nDATALINK|70\r\nBOOLEAN|16\r\nROWID|-8\r\nNCHAR|-15\r\nNVARCHAR|-9\r\nLONGNVARCHAR|-16\r\nNCLOB|2011\r\nSQLXML|2009\r\nREF_CURSOR|2012\r\nTIME_WITH_TIMEZONE|2013\r\nTIMESTAMP_WITH_TIMEZONE|2014\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nyes, the unrecognized jdbc type error will also print the type name \r\n\r\nFor example, \r\n\r\n```java\r\n org.apache.spark.SparkSQLException: Unrecognized SQL type - name: TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE, id: -102\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nnew tests\r\n",

  "body": "\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe PR fixes a bug that SparkListenerTaskStart can have `stageAttemptId = -1` when a task is launched after the stage is cancelled. Actually, we should use the information within `Task` to update the `stageAttemptId` field.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n-1 is not a legal stageAttemptId value, thus it can lead to unexpected problem if a subscriber try to parse the stage information from the SparkListenerTaskStart event.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, it's a bugfix.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually verified.",

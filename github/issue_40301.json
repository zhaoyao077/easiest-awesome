If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nOptimize `Utils.bytesToString`. Arithmetic ops on `BigInt` and `BigDecimal` are order(s) of magnitude slower than the ops on primitive types. Division is an especially slow operation and it is used en masse here.\r\n\r\nTo avoid heating up the Earth while formatting byte counts for human consumption we observe that most formatting operations are not in the 10s of EiBs but on counts that fit in 64-bits and use (fastpath) 64-bit operations to format them.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUse of `Utils.bytesToString` is prevalent through the codebase and they are mainly used in logs. If the logs are emitted then this becomes a heavyweight operation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n",

[, default]) - Compares expr\r\n      to each search value in order. If expr is equal to a search value, decode returns\r\n      the corresponding result. If no match is found, then it returns default. If default\r\n      is omitted, it returns null.\r\n\r\nExtended Usage:\r\n    Examples:\r\n      > SELECT decode(encode('abc', 'utf-8'), 'utf-8');\r\n       abc\r\n      > SELECT decode(2, 1, 'Southlake', 2, 'San Francisco', 3, 'New Jersey', 4, 'Seattle', 'Non domestic');\r\n       San Francisco\r\n      > SELECT decode(6, 1, 'Southlake', 2, 'San Francisco', 3, 'New Jersey', 4, 'Seattle', 'Non domestic');\r\n       Non domestic\r\n      > SELECT decode(6, 1, 'Southlake', 2, 'San Francisco', 3, 'New Jersey', 4, 'Seattle');\r\n       NULL\r\n\r\n    Since: 3.2.0\r\n\r\nTime taken: 0.074 seconds, Fetched 4 row(s)\r\n```\r\n``` shell\r\nspark-sql> select decode(6, 1, 'Southlake', 2, 'San Francisco', 3, 'New Jersey', 4, 'Seattle');\r\nNULL\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`df.show` keep consistent behavior when handle `null` with spark-sql CLI.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, `null` will display NULL instead of null.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nGA",

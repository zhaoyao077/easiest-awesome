  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds direct serialization from user domain objects to arrow batches. This removes the need to go through catalyst.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe want to minimalize the number of dependencies in connect. Removing catalyst and core is part of this effort.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI added the `ArrowEncoderSuite` to test this.",

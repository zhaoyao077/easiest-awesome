  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMost uses of `Random` in spark are either in testcases or where we need a pseudo random number which is repeatable.\r\nUse `SecureRandom`, instead of `Random` for the cases where it impacts security.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nUse of `SecureRandom` in more security sensitive contexts.\r\nThis was flagged in our internal scans as well.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nDirectly no.\r\nWould improve security posture of Apache Spark.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests",

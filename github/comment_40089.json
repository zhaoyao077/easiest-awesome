That is why this is different that API that is built on top of the scala API, that was new, this however is not, it should be or at least aspires to be the same API. Hence my argument that you could also use the original since tags. Anyway I am fine with updating them, like I did in other PRs, I just missed it in this case.\r\n\r\nAs for the removal of deprecated methods. Again we want to be as compatible as possible, so I want to given users access to them. We aspire that in the best case a user can migrate their code to connect without any issues (preferably no recompilation). I don't think we should ever remove these methods, they are poorly named that is all. They do not inhibit us in any way to keep evolving Spark since they are just aliases. I have kept out a few deprecated methods in the current connect Dataset, but I do intent to bring them back once we can support them.\r\n\r\n",

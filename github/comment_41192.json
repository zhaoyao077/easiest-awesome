    "body": "I believe one main problem of carrying the byte buffer is that it's serialized and deserialized when scheduling tasks. \r\n\r\nWhen the `FileDescritptorSet` size is large enough or many protobuf functions are used, task size would be larger and cause some scheduling overhead. It would be much lightweighter to just carrying the file path name.\r\n\r\nTo address that problem, we would normally broadcast the byte buffer, however that may not work well with spark connect?\r\n\r\nDo you think it's necessary to give users the option to pass by descriptor file a.k.a the current behavior ?",

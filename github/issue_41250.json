  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR implements `SparkSession.addArtifact(s)`. The logic is basically translated from Scala (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40256) to Python here.\r\n\r\nOne difference is that, it does not support `class` files and `cache` (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40827) because it's not realistic for Python client to add `class` files. For `cache`, this implementation will be used as a base work.\r\n\r\nThis PR is also a base work to implement sending py-files and archive files\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor feature parity w/ Scala client. In addition, this is also base work for `cache` implementation, and Python dependency management (https://www.databricks.com/blog/2020/12/22/how-to-manage-python-dependencies-in-pyspark.html)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this exposes an API `SparkSession.addArtifact(s)`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittests were added. Also manually tested.\r\n",

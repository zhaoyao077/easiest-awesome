I hope to reuse `GenerateMIMAIgnore` base on master to generate `.generated-mima-class-excludes` and `.generated-mima-member-excludes` during  `dev/connect-jvm-client-mima-check` check process(https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40925), then I encountered this problem.\r\n\r\n2. In the long run, when we need to performing mima check between Spark 3.6.0 and Spark 3.5.0, we will also need to solve this problem if jackson-core always with Java 11/19 code(due to the `OLD_DEPS_CLASSPATH` will also contain jackson-core 2.15.0+), but this can indeed be fixed when things happen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have give an independent pr to solve this issue.

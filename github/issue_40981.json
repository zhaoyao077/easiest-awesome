  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd RocksDB state store memory management enhancements\r\n\r\nThis change does the following:\r\n\r\n- remove use of writeBatchWithIndex\r\n- move towards using Native RocksDB operations\r\n- remove use of RocksDB WAL\r\n- add support for bounding memory usage for all RocksDB state store instances on executor using the write buffer manager\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nToday when RocksDB is used as a State Store provider, memory usage when writing using writeBatch is not capped. Also, a related issue is that the state store coordinator can create multiple RocksDB instances on a single node without enforcing a global limit on native memory usage. Due to these issues we could run into OOM issues and task failures. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests and fixed existing ones\r\n\r\nRocksDBStateStoreSuite\r\n```\r\n[info] Run completed in 40 seconds, 916 milliseconds.\r\n[info] Total number of tests run: 33\r\n[info] Suites: completed 1, aborted 0\r\n[info] Tests: succeeded 33, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0\r\n[info] All tests passed.\r\n```\r\n\r\nStateStoreSuite\r\n```\r\n\r\n[info] Run completed in 2 minutes, 33 seconds.\r\n[info] Total number of tests run: 85\r\n[info] Suites: completed 1, aborted 0\r\n[info] Tests: succeeded 85, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0\r\n[info] All tests passed.\r\n```\r\n",

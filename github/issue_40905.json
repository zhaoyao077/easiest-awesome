  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe add a logging when creating the batch reader with task ID, topic, partition and offset range included.\r\nThe log line looks like following:\r\n\r\n23/04/18 22:35:38 INFO KafkaBatchReaderFactory: Creating Kafka reader partitionId=1 partition=StreamingDustTest-KafkaToKafkaTopic-4ccf8662-c3ca-4f3b-871e-1853c0e61765-source-2 fromOffset=0 untilOffset=3 queryId=b5b806c3-ebf3-432e-a9a7-d882d474c0f5 batchId=0 taskId=1\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRight now, for structure streaming from Kafka, it's hard to finding which task handling which topic/partition and offset range. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRun KafkaMicroBatchV2SourceSuite and watch logging outputs contain information needed. Also does a small cluster test and observe logs.\r\n",

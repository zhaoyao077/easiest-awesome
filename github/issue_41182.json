  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to upgrade mysql-connector-java from 8.0.32 to 8.0.33\r\n`Version 8.0.33 is the latest General Availability release of the 8.0 series of MySQL Connector/J. It is suitable for use with MySQL Server versions 8.0 and 5.7. It supports the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) 4.2 API, and implements the X DevAPI.`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1.This version brings some bugs fixes, the release note as follows:\r\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/connector-j/8.0/en/news-8-0-33.html\r\n\r\n2.Bugs Fixed(https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/connector-j/8.0/en/news-8-0-33.html#connector-j-8-0-33-bug), eg:\r\n\r\n- When connecting to MySQL Server 5.7 and earlier with Connector/J 8.0.32, Connector/J sometimes hung after the prepare phase of a server-side prepared statement. (Bug #109864, Bug #35034666)\r\nReferences: This issue is a regression of: Bug #33968169.\r\n\r\n- Results returned by the getPrimaryKeys() method of the DatabaseMetadata interface were not sorted by COLUMN_NAME as required by the JDBC specification. (Bug #109808, Bug #35021038)\r\n\r\n- Results returned by the getTypeInfo() method of the DatabaseMetadata interface were not sorted by DATA_TYPE as required by the JDBC specification. (Bug #109807, Bug #35021014)\r\n\r\n- Rewriting of batched statements failed when a closing parenthesis was found within a VALUES clause. It was because QueryInfo failed to parse the prepared statement properly in that case. With this fix, the parser of VALUES clauses is improved, so that Connector/J is now able to recognize rewritability of statements that contain function calls or multiple VALUES lists, and it also handles well the cases when the string \"value\" is part of a table name, a column name, or a keyword. (Bug #109377, Bug #34900156, Bug #107577, Bug #34325361)\r\n\r\n- Before executing a query with Statement.executeQuery(query), Connector/J checks if the query is going to produce results and rejects it if it cannot. The check wrongly rejected queries that had a WITH clause in which there was no space after the comma between two common table expressions. (Bug #109243, Bug #34852047)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GA.",

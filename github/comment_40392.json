I have a concern. Currently, Apache Spark uses K8s Service entity via [DriverServiceFeatureStep](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/resource-managers/kubernetes/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/k8s/features/DriverServiceFeatureStep.scala) to access Spark driver pod in K8s environment.\r\n\r\ndo you still concern that now?",

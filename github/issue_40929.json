If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds lazy allocation support for the backing array of ColumnVector used in Spark VectorizedReader. \r\n The scope of this change includes:\r\n- Simplify `OnHeapColumnVector` to only use a single-byte array for various data types.\r\n- Introduced lazy loading to the `data` array, e.g.: allocating the array only on the first write. \r\n- Changed `nulls` byte array to use `BitSet` for a smaller memory footprint and faster batch operations.\r\n\r\nOut of scope of this PR:\r\n- Lazy allocation support for `OffHeapColumnVector`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis PR is added as a memory optimization for addressing the memory utilization issue when reading a Parquet file with large but sparse columns.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests:\r\n* ColumnarBatchSuite\r\n* ColumnVectorSuite\r\n* ColumnVectorUtilsSuite\r\n* ConstantColumnVectorSuite\r\n\r\nManual tests:\r\nTested on reading a Parquet file with a large nested struct with an array with 16GB executors. This patch fixed the OutOfMemory exception.\r\n",

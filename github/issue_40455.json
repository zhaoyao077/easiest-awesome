  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd support for setting max_write_buffer_number and write_buffer_size for RocksDB used in streaming\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe need these settings in order to control memory tuning for RocksDB. We already expose settings for blockCache size. However, these 2 settings are missing. This change proposes to add them.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests and docs in the guide doc\r\nRocksDBSuite\r\n```\r\n[info] Run completed in 59 seconds, 336 milliseconds.\r\n[info] Total number of tests run: 27\r\n[info] Suites: completed 1, aborted 0\r\n[info] Tests: succeeded 27, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0\r\n[info] All tests passed.\r\n[success] Total time: 165 s (02:45), completed Mar 15, 2023, 11:24:17 PM\r\n```\r\nRocksDBStateStoreSuite\r\n```\r\n[info] Run completed in 1 minute, 16 seconds.\r\n[info] Total number of tests run: 73\r\n[info] Suites: completed 1, aborted 0\r\n[info] Tests: succeeded 73, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0\r\n[info] All tests passed.\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

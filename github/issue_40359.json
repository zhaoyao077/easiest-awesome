  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, the DS V2 pushdown framework pushed offset as `OFFSET n` in default and pushed it with limit as `LIMIT m OFFSET n`. But some built-in dialect doesn't support these syntax. So, when Spark pushdown offset into these databases, them throwing errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix the bug that pushdown offset or paging is invalid for some built-in dialect.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'Yes'.\r\nThe bug will be fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew test cases.\r\n",

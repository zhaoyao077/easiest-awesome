  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdded the agg, reduce support in `KeyValueGroupedDataset`.\r\nAdded `Dataset#reduce`\r\nAdded `RelationalGroupedDataset#as`.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n* `KVGDS#agg`: `KVGDS#agg` and the `RelationalGroupedDS#agg` shares the exact same proto. The only difference is that the KVGDS always passing a UDF as the first grouping expression. That's also how we tell them apart in this PR.\r\n* `KVGDS#reduce`: Reduce is a special aggregation. The client uses an UnresolvedFunc \"reduce\" to mark the agg operator is a `ReduceAggregator` and calls `KVGDS#agg` directly. The server would be able to pick this func up directly and reuse the agg code path by sending in a `ReduceAggregator`.\r\n* `Dataset#reduce`: This is free after `KVGDS#reduce`.\r\n* `RelationalGroupedDS#as`: The only difference between `KVGDS` created using `ds#groupByKey` and `ds#agg#as` is the grouping expressions. The former requires one grouping func as the grouping expression, the latter uses a dummy func (to pass encoders/types to the server) + grouping expressions. Thus the server can count how many grouping expressions received and decide if the `KVGDS` should be created as `ds#groupByKey` or `ds#agg#as`.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowups: \r\n* [SPARK-43415] Support mapValues in the Agg functions. \r\n* [SPARK-43416] The tupled ProductEncoder dose not pick up the fields names from the server.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMissing APIs in Scala Client\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAdded `KeyValueGrouppedDataset#agg, reduce`, `Dataset#reduce`, `RelationalGroupedDataset#as` methods for the Scala client.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nE2E tests",

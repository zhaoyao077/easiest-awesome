  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n* Move code related to execution from being done directly in the GRPC callback in SparkConnextStreamHandler, to it's own classes.\r\n* `ExecutionHolder` (renamed from `ExecutePlanHolder`) launches the execution in it's own thread.\r\n* The execution returns responses via `ExecutePlanResponseObserver`\r\n* The actual execution code is refactored into `SparkConnectPlanExecution`\r\n\r\nThis allows to improve query interruption, by making `interrupt` method interrupt the execution thread. This makes `interrupt` work also when no Spark Jobs are running.\r\n\r\nThe refactoring further opens the possibilities of detaching query execution from a single RPC execution. Right now `ExecutionHolder` is waiting for the execution thread to finish, and `ExecutePlanResponseObserver` is forwarding the responses directly to the RPC observer.\r\n\r\nIn a followup, we can design different modes of execution, e.g.\r\n`ExecutePlanResponseObserver` buffering the responses. A client which lost connection could then reconnect and ask for the stream to be retransmitted.\r\n* `ExecutionHolder` returning the operationId to the client directly, and then client requesting results in separate RPCs, with more control over the response stream, instead of having it just pushed to it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n* Improve the working of `interrupt`\r\n* Refactoring that opens up possibilities of detaching query execution from a single RPC.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting Spark Connect CI covers the execution.\r\n",

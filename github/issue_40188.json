  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to document how to perform chained time window aggregations. Although it is introduced as a way to perform chained time window aggregations, it can be also used \"generally\" to apply operations which require timestamp column against the time window data.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe didn't document the new functionality in the guide doc in SPARK-40925. There was a doc change SPARK-42105, but it only mentioned the unblock of limitations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, documentation change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCreated a page via `SKIP_API=1 bundle exec jekyll serve --watch` and confirmed. \r\nScreenshot:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"611\" alt=\"스크린샷 2023-02-28 오전 8 32 24\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1317309/221713232-3ea906ce-23f6-4293-82c0-de1e69ea1ee8.png\">\r\n\r\n",

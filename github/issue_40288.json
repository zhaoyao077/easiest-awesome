Adding a brief description of Spark Connect to the main page will inform users about this feature and how it can benefit their use cases. Additionally, the note about the experimental nature of this feature will help users understand the potential risks of using Spark Connect in production environments.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo for API usage, but this PR introduces a user-facing documents by adding a new section about Spark Connect to the PySpark main page.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the documentation builds correctly, the `make clean html` command was executed to test the build process.",

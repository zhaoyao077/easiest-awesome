    "body": "Hi @Hisoka-X \r\n\r\nGood day. I would like to know whether this pull request to for spark sql query with delta lake delta table v2.\r\nI simply encounter this issue with spark 3.2 (delta lake 1.2) and spark 3.3 (delta lake 2.2), which I think this pull request could help resolve this issue.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/51392682/591ada27-5525-402e-995d-14f5c3c3f11f)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/51392682/0908e173-325e-4057-be6b-c9ae5e990f8f)\r\n\r\nI saw this ANALYZE TABLE command is originated from spark : https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.3.1/sql-ref-syntax-aux-analyze-table.html#analyze-table. But delta lake documentation do not mention ANALYZE TABLE usage https://docs.delta.io/2.2.0/delta-intro.html.\r\n\r\nSince this pull request will merge to master branch and want to know **whether it will backfill to spark 3.2, spark 3.3 also**. \r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nJerry",

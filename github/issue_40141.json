  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nProtobuf deserializer (`from_protobuf()` function()) optionally supports recursive fields up to certain depth. Currently it uses `NullType` to terminate the recursion. But an `ArrayType` containing `NullType` is not really useful and  it does not work delta.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by removing the field to terminate recursion rather than using `NullType`. \r\nThe following example illustrates the difference. \r\n\r\nE.g. Consider a recursive Protobuf like this:\r\n```\r\nmessage Node {\r\n    int value = 1;\r\n    repeated Node children = 2  // recursive array\r\n}\r\nmessage Tree {\r\n    Node root = 1\r\n}\r\n```\r\nCatalyst schama with `from_protobuf()` of `Tree` with max recursive depth set to 2, would be:\r\n \r\n   - **Before**:  _STRUCT<root: STRUCT<value: int, children: array<STRUCT<value: int, **children: array< void >**>>>>_\r\n   - **After**: _STRUCT<root: STRUCT<value: int, children: array<STRUCT<value: int>>>>_\r\n\r\nNotice that at second level, the `children` array is dropped, rather than being defined as `array<void>`. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n - This improves how Protobuf connector handles recursive fields. It avoids using `void` fields which are problematic in many scenarios and do not add any information.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n - This changes the schema in a subtle manner while using with recursive support enabled. Since this only removes an optional field, it is backward compatible. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n - Added multiple unit tests and updated existing one. Most of the changes for this PR are in the tests. \r\n\r\n",

  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds a new dependency on the datasketches-java project, and provides 4 new functions which utilize Datasketches HllSketch and Union instances for unique counting and intermediate storage of HLL sketches. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe existing approx_count_distinct provides unique counting functionality, but does not provide the ability to store HLL sketches for re-aggregation. After discussions with the Databricks team, we decided that integrating the Datasketches HllSketch implementation would make more sense than extending the existing approx_count_distinct functionality, given the wide use of the Datasketches library. See https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39678 and https://github.com/RyanBerti/spark/pull/1 for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this PR introduces two new aggregate functions:\r\n- hll_sketch_agg\r\n- hll_union_agg\r\n\r\nAnd two new scalar functions:\r\n- hll_sketch_estimate\r\n- hll_union\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI've included various tests in the DataframeAggregateSuite and new DatasketchesHllSketchSuite test suite.\r\n",

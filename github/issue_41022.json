  "body": "\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen FileStreamSource creates a DataSource for a file, disable globbing in the option passed to DataSource.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt is to fix following bug.\r\n\r\nFor example, If a directory contains a following file:\r\n/path/abc[123]\r\nand users would load spark.readStream.format(\"text\").load(\"/path\") as stream input. It throws an exception, saying no matching path /path/abc[123]. Spark thinks abc[123] is a regex that only matches file named abc1, abc2 and abc3.\r\n\r\nThe bug is due to a second glob pattern match within DataSource, against files already glob matched by FileStreamSource. This match turns real file name into file path match pattern. It is unexpected and we would like to disable it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, except fixing the unexpected buggy behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit test scenarios which failed before the fix.\r\n",

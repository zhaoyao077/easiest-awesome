  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd the ```to_varchar``` alias for ```to_char``` to support additional SQL functions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo minimize code changes for people using Spark SQL who are used to other engines that support ```to_varchar```.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. The user can now invoke ```to_varchar``` instead of ```to_char``` in their SQL applications.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n```to_varchar``` was added in ```numeric.sql``` and a new Golden file was generated to check that the query output was correct.\r\n",

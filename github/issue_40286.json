  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently a stage will be resubmitted in a few scenarios:\r\n1. Task failed with `FetchFailed` will trigger stage re-submit;\r\n2. Barrier task failed;\r\n3. Shuffle data loss due to executor/host decommissioned;\r\n\r\nFor the first 2 scenarios, there is a config `spark.stage.maxConsecutiveAttempts` to limit the retry times. While for the 3rd scenario, there'll be potential risks for inifinite retry if there are always executors hosting the shuffle data from successful tasks got killed/lost, the stage will be re-run again and again.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the potential risk, the proposal in this PR is to add a new config `spark.stage.maxConsecutiveAttempts` to limit the overall max attempts number for each stage, the stage will be aborted once the retry times beyond the limitation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo avoid the potential risks for stage infinite retry.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAdded limitation for stage retry times, so jobs may fail if they need to retry for mutiplte times beyond the limitation.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new UT.\r\n",

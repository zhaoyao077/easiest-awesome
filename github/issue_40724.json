If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a `TorchDistributor` method API :\r\n\r\n```\r\n    def _train_on_dataframe(self, train_function, spark_dataframe, *args, **kwargs):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Runs distributed training using provided spark DataFrame as input data.\r\n        You should ensure the input spark DataFrame have evenly divided partitions,\r\n        and this method starts a barrier spark job that each spark task in the job\r\n        process one partition of the input spark DataFrame.\r\n\r\n        Parameters\r\n        ----------\r\n        train_function :\r\n            Either a PyTorch function, PyTorch Lightning function that launches distributed\r\n            training. Note that inside the function, you can call\r\n            `pyspark.ml.torch.distributor.get_spark_partition_data_loader` API to get a torch\r\n            data loader, the data loader loads data from the corresponding partition of the\r\n            input spark DataFrame.\r\n        spark_dataframe :\r\n            An input spark DataFrame that can be used in PyTorch `train_function` function.\r\n            See `train_function` argument doc for details.\r\n        args :\r\n            `args` need to be the input parameters to `train_function` function. It would look like\r\n\r\n            >>> model = distributor.run(train, 1e-3, 64)\r\n\r\n            where train is a function and 1e-3 and 64 are regular numeric inputs to the function.\r\n        kwargs :\r\n            `kwargs` need to be the key-work input parameters to `train_function` function.\r\n            It would look like\r\n\r\n            >>> model = distributor.run(train, tol=1e-3, max_iter=64)\r\n\r\n            where train is a function that has 2 arguments `tol` and `max_iter`.\r\n\r\n        Returns\r\n        -------\r\n            Returns the output of `train_function` called with args inside spark rank 0 task.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdded an API:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef _get_spark_partition_data_loader(num_samples, batch_size, prefetch=2):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    This function must be called inside the `train_function` where `train_function`\r\n    is the input argument of `TorchDistributor.train_on_dataframe`.\r\n    The function returns a pytorch data loader that loads data from\r\n    the corresponding spark partition data.\r\n\r\n    Parameters\r\n    ----------\r\n    num_samples :\r\n        Number of samples to generate per epoch. If `num_samples` is less than the number of\r\n        rows in the spark partition, it generate the first `num_samples` rows of\r\n        the spark partition, if `num_samples` is greater than the number of\r\n        rows in the spark partition, then after the iterator loaded all rows from the partition,\r\n        it wraps round back to the first row.\r\n    batch_size:\r\n        How many samples per batch to load.\r\n    prefetch:\r\n        Number of batches loaded in advance.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe added APIs are designed for spark 4.0 new ML module.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests.\r\n",

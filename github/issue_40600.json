  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd option to skip commit coordinator as part of StreamingWrite API for DSv2 sources/sinks. This option was already present as part of the BatchWrite API\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSinks such as the following are atleast-once for which we do not need to go through the commit coordinator on the driver to ensure that a single partition commits. This is even less useful for streaming use-cases where batches could be replayed from the checkpoint dir.\r\n\r\n- memory sink\r\n- console sink\r\n- no-op sink\r\n- Kafka v2 sink\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit test for the change\r\n```\r\n[info] ReportSinkMetricsSuite:\r\n22:23:01.276 WARN org.apache.hadoop.util.NativeCodeLoader: Unable to load native-hadoop library for your platform... using builtin-java classes where applicable\r\n22:23:03.139 WARN org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.ResolveWriteToStream: spark.sql.adaptive.enabled is not supported in streaming DataFrames/Datasets and will be disabled.\r\n[info] - test ReportSinkMetrics with useCommitCoordinator=true (2 seconds, 709 milliseconds)\r\n22:23:04.522 WARN org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.ResolveWriteToStream: spark.sql.adaptive.enabled is not supported in streaming DataFrames/Datasets and will be disabled.\r\n[info] - test ReportSinkMetrics with useCommitCoordinator=false (373 milliseconds)\r\n22:23:04.941 WARN org.apache.spark.sql.streaming.ReportSinkMetricsSuite:\r\n\r\n===== POSSIBLE THREAD LEAK IN SUITE o.a.s.sql.streaming.ReportSinkMetricsSuite, threads: ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-19 (daemon=true), rpc-boss-3-1 (daemon=true), shuffle-boss-6-1 (daemon=true) =====\r\n[info] Run completed in 4 seconds, 934 milliseconds.\r\n[info] Total number of tests run: 2\r\n[info] Suites: completed 1, aborted 0\r\n[info] Tests: succeeded 2, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0\r\n[info] All tests passed.\r\n```",

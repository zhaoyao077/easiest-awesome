  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR is a follow-up to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40234, which makes it possible for extensions to create custom `Dataset`s and `Column`s. It exposes `Dataset.plan`, but unfortunately it does not expose `Column.expr`. This means that extensions cannot build custom `Column`s that provide a user provider `Column` as input.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSee above.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. This only adds a change for a Developer API.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests to make sure nothing breaks.\r\n",

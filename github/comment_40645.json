    "body": "> I understand what you aim to achieve in this PR. In case of K8s Cluster Mode, the driver pod has a driver `ConfigMap` containing `spark.app.submitTime` already. So, you want to keep that. However, this is not safe because of the timezone between the user machine and the K8s control plane server.\r\n> \r\n> If we want to propose this improvement to include the driver pod pending time, we need to add a configuration to control this feature, @zhouyifan279 . Could you try to add a configuration and add an integration test case too?\r\n\r\n@dongjoon-hyun Can you elaborate about how timezone affects the computed driver pod pending time.\r\n\r\nAs I understand, both `spark.app.submitTime` and `spark.app.startTime` is milliseconds between the current time and midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC.\r\n",

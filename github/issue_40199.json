That author and reviewers thought it's a duplicate.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSPARK-41188 stopped setting OMP_NUM_THREADS to number of executor cores by default when running Python UDF on YARN.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual testing",

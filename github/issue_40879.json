  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n[StructType.findNestedField](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/db2625c70a8c3aff64e6a9466981c8dd49a4ca51/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/types/StructType.scala#L325) is unable to reach nested fields below two directly nested maps or arrays. Whenever it reaches a map or an array, it'll throw an `invalidFieldName` exception if the child is not a struct.\r\n\r\nThis change updates `findNestedField` to correctly recurse into two or more levels of directly nested maps or arrays.\r\n\r\nIn addition, use `checkError` in tests for `findNestedField` instead of manually checking error messages.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`findNestedField` is used for example in [`ALTER TABLE` commands](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/9e17731f46aa26348e69f42d1a96882186022b80/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/Analyzer.scala#L3735). It is currently not possible to add or modify a nested field within two or more levels of directly nested maps or arrays.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests are added to `StructTypeSuite` to cover deeply nested maps and arrays with `findNestedField`\r\n",

  "body": "### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe current validation on charset is restrictive. It does not allow\r\nblank space and digits. It's common for user agent strings to contain\r\nthese characters.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it restricts the length to stay under 200 characters.\r\nThe limit to 200 characters was mostly something that was done as a\r\nsimple protection mechanism. We've looked into different specifications\r\nfor what could be part of the user agent and longer user agents are\r\ncommon. Increase this restriction to 2KB.\r\nThe server should enforce restrictions on its side, but we would still like\r\nto keep the restriction as fallback protection, but allow large values.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests",

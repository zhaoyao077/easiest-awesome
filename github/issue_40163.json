If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7.

This log enables us to track cases where this load takes too long and we log a warning in such cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAugmented some of the tests to verify the logging is working as expected.\r\nSample logs:\r\n```\r\n14:58:51.784 WARN org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.state.StateStore: Loaded state store provider in loadTimeMs=2049 for storeId=StateStoreId[ checkpointRootLocation=file:/Users/anish.shrigondekar/spark/spark/target/tmp/streaming.metadata-1f2ff296-1ece-4a0c-b4b4-48aa0e909b49/\r\nstate, operatorId=0, partitionId=2, storeName=default ] and queryRunId=a4063603-3929-4340-9920-eca206ebec36\r\n14:58:53.838 WARN org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.state.StateStore: Loaded state store provider in loadTimeMs=2046 for storeId=StateStoreId[ checkpointRootLocation=file:/Users/anish.shrigondekar/spark/spark/target/tmp/streaming.metadata-1f2ff296-1ece-4a0c-b4b4-48aa0e909b49/\r\nstate, operatorId=0, partitionId=3, storeName=default ] and queryRunId=a4063603-3929-4340-9920-eca206ebec36\r\n14:58:55.885 WARN org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.state.StateStore: Loaded state store provider in loadTimeMs=2044 for storeId=StateStoreId[ checkpointRootLocation=file:/Users/anish.shrigondekar/spark/spark/target/tmp/streaming.metadata-1f2ff296-1ece-4a0c-b4b4-48aa0e909b49/\r\nstate, operatorId=0, partitionId=4, storeName=default ] and queryRunId=a4063603-3929-4340-9920-eca206ebec36\r\n```\r\n",

  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds Ammonite REPL integration for Spark Connect. This has a couple of benefits:\r\n- It makes it a lot less cumbersome for users to start a spark connect REPL. You don't have to add custom scripts, and you can use `coursier` to launch a fully function REPL for you.\r\n- It adds REPL integration for to the actual build. This makes it easier to validate the code we add is actually working.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nA REPL is arguably the first entry point for a lot of users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes it adds REPL integration.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests for the command line parsing. Manually tested the REPL.\r\n",

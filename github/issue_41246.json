The main impact of the bug was that\r\ngenerated code would be missing comments.\r\n- Fix issue in buf curl when using --user or --netrc that would cause a malformed Authorization header to be sent.\r\n\r\n2.https://github.com/bufbuild/buf/compare/v1.18.0...v1.19.0\r\n\r\n3.Manually test: dev/connect-gen-protos.sh, this upgrade will not change the generated files.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually test and Pass GA.",

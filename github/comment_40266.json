    "body": "This change makes sense to me and new plans look ok to me.\r\nHowever, seemingly `InferFiltersFromConstraints` has a dedicated place in the optimizer and so there are 2 special batches `Operator Optimization before Inferring Filters` and `Operator Optimization after Inferring Filters` before and after the rule to make sure the inferred filtes are optimized. It also seems like the `RewriteSubquery` batch slowly becomes larger and larger with rules from those batches (see SPARK-39511, SPARK-22662, SPARK-36280). And now you want to add `InferFiltersFromConstraints` too. So I wonder if `RewritePredicateSubquery` is at the right place or what else would make sense to be executed after `RewritePredicateSubquery`? Maybe rerunning a full `operatorOptimizationBatch` would make sense despite it comes with a cost?",

They also added one rule to push LeftSemi/LeftAnti through join, but that has been added in 3.0 by [SPARK-19712](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19712). So now we only need to change rule position.\r\n\r\nIf this seems right to you guys, I can update this PR to move `RewritePredicateSubquery` after `Subqury` batch?",

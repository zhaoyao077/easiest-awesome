  "body": " When we calculate the quantile information from the peak executor metrics values for the distribution, there is a possibility of running into an `ArrayIndexOutOfBounds` exception when the metric values are empty. This PR addresses that and fixes it by returning an empty array if the values are empty.\r\n\r\n ### Why are the changes needed?\r\n Without these changes, when the withDetails query parameter is used to query the stages REST API, we encounter a partial JSON response since the peak executor metrics distribution cannot be serialized due to the above index error.\r\n\r\n ### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n No\r\n\r\n ### How was this patch tested?\r\n Added a unit test to test this behavior\r\n",

  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the `SQLQueryTestSuite` to also consume the same input SQL queries from the input files in second pass and then perform analysis and generate the string representation of the analyzed plans, in a separate new directory. It works much the same way as the previous `SQLQueryTestSuite` behavior except that it now also produces analyzed plan string instead of just query results in the output golden files.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis framework will help us guard against bugs in future development by showing a clear signal when analyzer updates result in changes to the query plans for a body of test queries. PR authors and reviewers will be able to see the diffs for all changed plans during the review, and any unintentional plan changes will act as a signal for PR authors to adjust their code to prevent the changes from happening.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis test adds a new test suite and initial golden file. The new test suite passes as of this PR.",

  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nA `DataSourceV2` reporting a `KeyGroupedPartitioning` through `SupportsReportPartitioning` does not have to implement `HasPartitionKey`, and is thus not limited to a single key per partition.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBefore Spark 3.3, `DataSourceV2` implementations could report a `ClusteredDistribution` with more than just a single cluster value per partition. This allowed Spark to exploit the existing partitioning and avoid an extra hash partitioning shuffle step. Transformations like `groupBy` or window functions (with the right group / partitioning keys) would then be executed on the partitioning provided by the data source.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis improves performance as existing partitioning is reused.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests have been fixed. They falsely reported partitions with multiple keys via `HasPartitionKey`.",

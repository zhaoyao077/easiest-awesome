If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nReimplement `PercentileHeap` such that:\r\n- the percentile value is always in the `topHeap`, this speeds up `percentile` access\r\n- rebalance the heaps more efficiently by checking which heap should grow due to the new insertion and doing a rebalance based on target heap sizes\r\n- the heaps are java PriorityQueue's *without* comparators. Comparator call overhead slows down `poll`/`offer` by more than 2x. Instead implement a max-heap by `poll`/`offer` on the negated domain of numbers.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`PercentileHeap` is heavy weight enough to cause scheduling delays if inserted inside the scheduler loop.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded more extensive unittests.",

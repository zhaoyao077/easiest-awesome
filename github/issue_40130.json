  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds all the collections functions to `functions.scala` for Scala client. This is the last PR large functions PR, there are a few functions missing, these will be added later.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe want the Scala client to have API parity with the existing API\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it adds functions to the Spark Connect Scala Client.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests to `PlanGenerationTestSuite` and to `ProtoToPlanTestSuite`. I have added a few tests to `ClientE2ETestSuite` for lambda functions (to make sure name scoping works) and the array shuffle function (non-deterministic, hard to test with golden files).",

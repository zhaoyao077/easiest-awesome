I think the hint info for current java is not correct.to be honest, I think it is a copy-paste error from the hint info for sbt_version argument. I can create a PR in sbt/sbt project to see if it can be updated.",

Normally I'd say, does this make it harder to reason about changes if we pull a new copy from upstream? but probably not. This also probably doesn't fix any actual problem. I'm neutral on bothering to change these.",

  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`TorchDistributorLocalUnitTestsOnConnect` and `TorchDistributorLocalUnitTestsIIOnConnect` were not stable and occasionally got stuck. However, I can not reproduce the issue locally.\r\n\r\nThe two UTs were disabled, and this PR is to reenable them. I found that the all the tests for PyTorch set up the regular sessions or connect sessions in `setUp` and close them in `tearDown`, however such session operations are very expensive and should be placed into `setUpClass` and `tearDownClass` instead. After this change, the related tests seems much stable. So I think the root cause is still related to the resources, since TorchDistributor works on barrier mode, when there is not enough resources in Github Action, the tests just keep waiting.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nfor test coverage\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, test-only\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nCI",

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

The general idea is to split the default column value resolution into two parts:\r\n1. resolve the column \"DEFAULT\" to the column default expression. This applies to `Project`/`UnresolvedInlineTable` under `InsertIntoStatement`, and assignment expressions in `UpdateTable`/`MergeIntoTable`.\r\n2. fill missing columns with column default values for the input query. This does not apply to UPDATE and non-INSERT action of MERGE as they use the column from the target table as the default value.\r\n\r\nThe first part should be done for all the data sources, as it's part of column resolution. The second part should not be applied to v2 data sources with `ACCEPT_ANY_SCHEMA`, as they are free to define how to handle missing columns.\r\n\r\nMore concretely, this PR:\r\n1. put the column \"DEFAULT\" resolution logic in the rule `ResolveReferences`, with two new virtual rules. This is to follow https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38888\r\n2. put the missing column handling in `TableOutputResolver`, which is shared by both the v1 and v2 insertion resolution rule. External v2 data sources can add custom catalyst rules to deal with missing columns for themselves.\r\n3. Remove the old rule `ResolveDefaultColumns`. Note that, with the refactor, we no long need to manually look up the table. We will deal with column default values after the target table of INSERT/UPDATE/MERGE is resolved.\r\n4. Remove the rule `ResolveUserSpecifiedColumns` and merge it to `PreprocessTableInsertion`. These two rules are both to resolve v1 insertion, and it's tricky to reason about their interactions. It's clearer to resolve the insertion with one pass.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  5. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\ncode cleanup and remove unneeded DS v2 API.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nupdated tests",

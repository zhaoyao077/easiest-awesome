  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to do not cache local port.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen Spark Context is stopped, and started again, the Spark Connect server shuts down and starts up again too (while JVM itself is alive). So, we should not cache the local port but have the new local port.\r\n\r\nFor example, in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40109, the Spark Connect server at `ReadwriterTestsMixin` stops after the tests. And then, `ReadwriterV2TestsMixin` starts the new Spark Connect server which causes failures on any actual protobuf message exchanges to the server.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, test-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI tested it on the top of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40109. That PR should validate it.",

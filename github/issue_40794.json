  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes DSL expressions on attributes with special characters by making `DslAttr.attr` and `DslAttr.expr` return the implicitly wrapped attribute instead of creating a new one.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSPARK-43142: DSL expressions on attributes with special characters don't work even if the attribute names are quoted:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> import org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.dsl.expressions._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.dsl.expressions._\r\n\r\nscala> \"`slashed/col`\".attr\r\nres0: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.UnresolvedAttribute = 'slashed/col\r\n\r\nscala> \"`slashed/col`\".attr.asc\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException:\r\nmismatched input '/' expecting {<EOF>, '.', '-'}(line 1, pos 7)\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\nslashed/col\r\n-------^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\nDSL expressions rely on a call to `expr` to get child of the new expression [(e.g.)](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/87a5442f7ed96b11051d8a9333476d080054e5a0/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/dsl/package.scala#L149).\r\n\r\n`expr` here is a call on implicit class `DslAttr` that's wrapping the `UnresolvedAttribute` returned by `\"...\".attr` is wrapped by the implicit class `DslAttr`.\r\n\r\n`DslAttr` and its super class implement `DslAttr.expr` such that a new `UnresolvedAttribute` is created from `UnresolvedAttribute.name` of the wrapped attribute [(here)](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/87a5442f7ed96b11051d8a9333476d080054e5a0/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/dsl/package.scala#L273-L280).\r\n\r\nBut that's no good, because `UnresolvedAttribute.name` drops the quotes and thus the newly created `UnresolvedAttribute` parses an identifier that should be quoted but isn't:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> \"`col/slash`\".attr.name\r\nres5: String = col/slash\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nDSL expressions on attributes with special characters no longer fail.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI couldn't find a suite testing the implicit classes in the DSL package, but the DSL package seems used widely enough that I'm confident this doesn't break existing behavior.\r\n\r\nLocally, I was able to reproduce with this test; it was failing before and passes now:\r\n```scala\r\ntest(\"chained DSL expressions on attributes with special characters\") {\r\n  $\"`slashed/col`\".asc\r\n}\r\n```",

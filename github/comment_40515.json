    "body": "@dongjoon-hyun officially is a bit a broad term. As far as I am concerned ammonite is just a way to use the connect JVM client, it is not meant as a change for all of Spark (although I do think it might make sense). We use other libraries all the time, and I don't think we have ever discussed those in the mailing list.\r\n\r\nAs it stands there are two reasons for using ammonite:\r\n- It is a better and easier to use REPL than the Scala REPL ever was.\r\n- It is easier to customize. Connect is a good illustration, for the Scala REPL I will probably need to the same thing as we did for the spark REPL project and that is fork the source code. In ammonite this was a minor modification.\r\n\r\nI do intent to add support for the regular REPL at some point, this was just easier to get started with.\r\n\r\nIf you feel strongly about this then I am happy to send a message to the dev-list.",

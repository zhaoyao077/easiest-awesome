However, shutdown hook has a well-known limitation where JVM can be destroyed abruptly and K8s Pod can be deleted also without giving the inside processes enough time to handle business logic.\r\n\r\n2. As I mentioned in the above, public cloud storage systems have a better and complete TTL-based solution for that issue. In that context, this PR is only trying to mitigate HDFS issue, https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-6382, partially.\r\n\r\n> The change to clean up the upload directory is not specific to HDFS.

    "body": "@dongjoon-hyun  Thanks for the clarification. But the unreliability for shutdown hook is common for all other shutdown tasks also. This doesn't mean we haven't impletened them. So, why this should stop us from adding the clean up logic. \r\nThe  TTL-based solution is specific to the filesystem. It's nice to have but I don't understand why we should rely on external solution to perform cleanup on behalf of spark job and why not the job itself does the cleanup? What's the downside of doing this?",

  "body": "Hey there, I noticed this project is referencing older Remote Plugins. There are upcoming [Remote Plugin changes](https://buf.build/blog/remote-packages-remote-plugins-approaching-v1) and this PR fixes the references to avoid any issues.\r\n\r\nOlder plugins on [buf.build](https://buf.build) will be removed in favor of Buf-managed plugins, which are managed by @bufbuild to ensure they work[^1] for the entire community.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the changes in this PR are as follows:\r\n\r\n- Update older plugins to reference the new plugins in `connector/connect/common/src/main/buf.gen.yaml`\r\n- Run `./dev/connect-gen-protos.sh` to generate the files\r\n\r\n[^1]: Buf has an open-source [bufbuild/plugins](https://github.com/bufbuild/plugins) repository that builds, tests, patches and automates publishing popular Protobuf plugins. All plugins in that repository are kept up-to-date and published to [buf.build/plugins](https://buf.build/plugins)",

  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `ProtoToPlanTestSuite` were broken for Scala 2.13 . This was caused by the following two problems:\r\n- Explain output between 2.12 and 2.13 is not stable because we render collection implementations as well. For this I changed the rendering of the offending classes to be version agnostic.\r\n- UDF code had deserialization issues. This was always the risk. I have removed those tests, we will work on improving UDF coverage in a follow-up.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe want to test Scala 2.13 as well.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTest only change.\r\n",

(https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/2326aef1a454a4eea363cc6ed8b8def8b88365f5)\r\n- Fix serialization warnings in generated code when compiling with Java 18 and above (https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/pull/10561)\r\n- Enable Text format parser to skip unknown short-formed repeated fields. (https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/6dbd4131fa6b2ad29b2b1b827f21fc61b160aeeb)\r\n- Add serialVersionUID to ByteString and subclasses (https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/pull/10718)\r\n\r\nand some bug fix like:\r\n- Mark default instance as immutable first to avoid race during static initialization of default instances. (https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/pull/10770)\r\n\r\n- Fix Timestamps fromDate for negative 'exact second' java.sql.Timestamps (https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/pull/10321)\r\n- Fix Timestamps.fromDate to correctly handle java.sql.Timestamps before unix epoch (https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/pull/10126)\r\n- Fix bug in nested builder caching logic where cleared sub-field builders would remain dirty after a clear and build in a parent layer. https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/10624\r\n\r\nThe release notes as follows:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/tag/v22.0\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions",

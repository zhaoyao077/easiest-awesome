    "body": "Thanks @dongjoon-hyun for your point : )\r\n\r\nThe intent of this PR is to change the way `df.show` represents the map data type, which is currently different from some mainstream databases. We also want `df.show` and `spark-sql `CLI to be as consistent as possible, since they are both spark CLI. So we think the representation after PR might be a better representation.\r\n\r\nAdding configuration is also a good idea.",

So we can skip unnecessary aggregate.\r\n\r\nOnly work when subquery without `group by` statement.\r\n\r\neg:\r\n```sql\r\ncreate or replace temp view l (a, b)\r\nas values\r\n    (1, 1.0),\r\n    (2, 2.0);\r\ncreate or replace temp view r (c, d)\r\nas values\r\n    (2, 3.0); \r\nselect a, (select (count(1)) is null from r where a = c) from l where a < 4\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe plan before this PR:\r\n```\r\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\r\n'Project ['a, unresolvedalias(scalar-subquery#240 [], None)]\r\n:  +- 'Project [unresolvedalias(isnull('count(1)), None)]\r\n:     +- 'Filter ('a = 'c)\r\n:        +- 'UnresolvedRelation [r], [], false\r\n+- 'Filter ('a < 4)\r\n   +- 'UnresolvedRelation [l], [], false\r\n\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\na: int, scalarsubquery(a): boolean\r\nProject [a#225, scalar-subquery#240 [a#225] AS scalarsubquery(a)#243]\r\n:  +- Aggregate [isnull(count(1)) AS (count(1) IS NULL)#242]\r\n:     +- Filter (outer(a#225) = c#236)\r\n:        +- SubqueryAlias r\r\n:           +- View (`r`, [c#236,d#237])\r\n:              +- Project [_1#231 AS c#236, _2#232 AS d#237]\r\n:                 +- LocalRelation [_1#231, _2#232]\r\n+- Filter (a#225 < 4)\r\n   +- SubqueryAlias l\r\n      +- View (`l`, [a#225,b#226])\r\n         +- Project [_1#220 AS a#225, _2#221 AS b#226]\r\n            +- LocalRelation [_1#220, _2#221]\r\n\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nProject [_1#220 AS a#225, if (isnull(alwaysTrue#246)) false else (count(1) IS NULL)#242 AS scalarsubquery(a)#243]\r\n+- Join LeftOuter, (_1#220 = c#236)\r\n   :- Project [_1#220]\r\n   :  +- Filter (isnotnull(_1#220) AND (_1#220 < 4))\r\n   :     +- LocalRelation [_1#220, _2#221]\r\n   +- Aggregate [c#236], [false AS (count(1) IS NULL)#242, c#236, true AS alwaysTrue#246]\r\n      +- Project [_1#231 AS c#236]\r\n         +- Filter ((_1#231 < 4) AND isnotnull(_1#231))\r\n            +- LocalRelation [_1#231, _2#232]\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=false\r\n+- Project [_1#220 AS a#225, if (isnull(alwaysTrue#246)) false else (count(1) IS NULL)#242 AS scalarsubquery(a)#243]\r\n   +- BroadcastHashJoin [_1#220], [c#236], LeftOuter, BuildRight, false\r\n      :- Project [_1#220]\r\n      :  +- Filter (isnotnull(_1#220) AND (_1#220 < 4))\r\n      :     +- LocalTableScan [_1#220, _2#221]\r\n      +- BroadcastExchange HashedRelationBroadcastMode(List(cast(input[1, int, true] as bigint)),false), [plan_id=120]\r\n         +- HashAggregate(keys=[c#236], functions=[], output=[(count(1) IS NULL)#242, c#236, alwaysTrue#246])\r\n            +- Exchange hashpartitioning(c#236, 5), ENSURE_REQUIREMENTS, [plan_id=117]\r\n               +- HashAggregate(keys=[c#236], functions=[], output=[c#236])\r\n                  +- Project [_1#231 AS c#236]\r\n                     +- Filter ((_1#231 < 4) AND isnotnull(_1#231))\r\n                        +- LocalTableScan [_1#231, _2#232]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe plan after this PR:\r\n```\r\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\r\n'Project ['a, unresolvedalias(scalar-subquery#240 [], None)]\r\n:  +- 'Project [unresolvedalias(isnull('count(1)), None)]\r\n:     +- 'Filter ('a = 'c)\r\n:        +- 'UnresolvedRelation [r], [], false\r\n+- 'Filter ('a < 4)\r\n   +- 'UnresolvedRelation [l], [], false\r\n\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\na: int, scalarsubquery(a): boolean\r\nProject [a#225, scalar-subquery#240 [a#225] AS scalarsubquery(a)#243]\r\n:  +- Aggregate [isnull(count(1)) AS (count(1) IS NULL)#242]\r\n:     +- Filter (outer(a#225) = c#236)\r\n:        +- SubqueryAlias r\r\n:           +- View (`r`, [c#236,d#237])\r\n:              +- Project [_1#231 AS c#236, _2#232 AS d#237]\r\n:                 +- LocalRelation [_1#231, _2#232]\r\n+- Filter (a#225 < 4)\r\n   +- SubqueryAlias l\r\n      +- View (`l`, [a#225,b#226])\r\n         +- Project [_1#220 AS a#225, _2#221 AS b#226]\r\n            +- LocalRelation [_1#220, _2#221]\r\n\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nProject [_1#220 AS a#225, false AS scalarsubquery(a)#243]\r\n+- Filter (isnotnull(_1#220) AND (_1#220 < 4))\r\n   +- LocalRelation [_1#220, _2#221]\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) Project [_1#220 AS a#225, false AS scalarsubquery(a)#243]\r\n+- *(1) Filter (isnotnull(_1#220) AND (_1#220 < 4))\r\n   +- *(1) LocalTableScan [_1#220, _2#221]\r\n```\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing.

    "body": "So we only keep it in the window between an executor requesting it's ID and it disconnecting to restabmudh a proper connection (generally <1s). Given it's a few bytes of information per outstanding executor without an ID assigned yet I'm not super worried about the memory usage.\n\nWe could also close the connection from the driver side instead I suppose but that might cause a race condition with the executor (would have to check how we handle disconnects and if we process outstanding messages).",

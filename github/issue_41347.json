The `duplicateResolved` in `Join` node are false. That's meaning the `Join` left and right have same `Attribute`, in this eg is `c1#224`. The right `c1#224` `Attribute` generated by having Inputs, because there are wrong having Inputs. \r\n\r\nThis problem only occurs when there contain having clause.\r\n\r\nalso do some code format fix.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

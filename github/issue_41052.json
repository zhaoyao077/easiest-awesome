  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe introduce the SQLConf `spark.sql.legacy.avro.allowReadingWithIncompatibleSchema` to prevent reading interval types as date or timestamp types to avoid getting corrupt dates as well as reading decimal types with incorrect precision.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe found the following issues with open source Avro:\r\n\r\n- Interval types can be read as date or timestamp types that would lead to wildly different results\r\n   For example, `Duration.ofDays(1).plusSeconds(1)` will be read as `1972-09-27`, which is weird.\r\n- Decimal types can be read with lower precision, that leads to data being read as `null` instead of suggesting that a wider decimal format should be provided\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit test\r\n",

If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new client-streaming RPC service \"AddArtifacts\" to handle the transfer of artifacts from the client to the server. New message types `AddArtifactsRequest` and `AddArtifactsResponse` are added that specify the format of artifact transfer.\r\n\r\nAn artifact is defined by its `name` and `data` fields.\r\n\r\n- `name`\r\n  - The name of the artifact is expected in the form of a \"Relative Path\" that is made up of a sequence of directories and the final file element.\r\n  - Examples of \"Relative Path\"s: `jars/test.jar`,  `classes/xyz.class`, `abc.xyz`, `a/b/X.jar`.\r\n  - The server is expected to maintain the hierarchy of files as defined by their name. (i.e The relative path of the file on the server's filesystem will be the same as the name of the provided artifact).\r\n- `data`\r\n  - The raw data of the artifact.\r\n\r\nThe intention behind the `name` format is to add extensibility to the approach. Through this scheme, the server can maintain the hierarchy/grouping of files in any way the client specifies as well as transfer different \"forms\" of artifacts without needing any updates to the protocol/code itself.\r\n\r\nThe protocol supports batching and chunking (due to gRPC size limits) of artifacts as required.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn the decoupled client-server architecture of Spark Connect, a remote client may use a local JAR or a new class in their UDF that may not be present on the server. To handle these cases of missing \"artifacts\", a protocol for artifact transfer is needed to move the required artifacts from the client side over to the server side.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nN/A",

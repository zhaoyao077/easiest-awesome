  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes to replace `EquivalentExpressions` to a simple mutable map in `PhysicalAggregation`, the only place where `EquivalentExpressions.addExpr()` is used. `EquivalentExpressions` is useful for common subexpression elimination but in `PhysicalAggregation` it is used only to deduplicate whole expressions which can be easily done with a simple map.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`EquivalentExpressions.addExpr()` is not guarded by `supportedExpression()` and so it can cause inconsistent results when used together with `EquivalentExpressions.getExprState()`. This PR proposes replacing `.addExpr()` with other alternatives as its boolean result is a bit counter-intuitive to other collections' `.add()` methods. It returns `false` if the expression was missing and either adds the expression or not depending on if the expression is deterministic.\r\nAfter this PR we no longer use `EquivalentExpressions.addExpr()` so it can be deprecated or even removed...\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new UTs from @rednaxelafx's PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40473. Please note that those UTs actually pass after https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40475, but they are added here to make sure there will be no regression in the future.\r\n",

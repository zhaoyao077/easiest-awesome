Should probably formulated myself more clearly that was only a guess on my part and not something I had verified. But now that you narrowed it down to 2.13.7 another possible candidate change could be https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9786 that changed how that mutations are tracked in ArrayBuffer. \r\n\r\nEDIT: Even if [scala/scala#9258](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9258) was tagged milestone 2.13.4 at some point it looks to me like it actually landed in 2.13.7 with this commit https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/5f250021e7e55dd36e45d0b224a6cb6967e67ebd\r\n\r\n",

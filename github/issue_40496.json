  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR enables the new golden file test framework for analysis for all input files.\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\n* In https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40449 we added the ability to exercise the analyzer on the SQL queries in existing golden files in the `sql/core/src/test/resources/sql-tests/inputs` directory, writing separate output test files in the new `sql/core/src/test/resources/sql-tests/analyzer-results` directory in additional to the original output directory for full end-to-end query execution results.\r\n* That PR also added an allowlist of input files to include in this new dual-run mode.\r\n* In this PR, we remove that allowlist exercise the new dual-run mode for all the input files. We also extend the analyzer testing to support separate test cases in ANSI-mode, TimestampNTZ, and UDFs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis improves test coverage and helps prevent against accidental regressions in the future as we edit the code.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds testing only.",

I actually can't recall if there were strong reasons to keep one or the other in the past; seems like there were Reasons we needed both. We do use mvn in a few places in scripts to parse out stuff about the build, like to determine when new dependencies have been added. mvn and sbt dependency resolution aren't the same, but all the more reason to just pick one, even if we have to migrate some scripts",

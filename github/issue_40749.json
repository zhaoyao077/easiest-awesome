  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFor push based shuffle metrics, when writting out the event to log file, the field name is [\"Push Based Shuffle\"](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/util/JsonProtocol.scala#L548).\r\nBut when parsing it out in SHS, the expected field name is [\"Shuffle Push Read Metrics\"](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/util/JsonProtocol.scala#L1264). This mismatch makes all the push shuffle metrics 0 from SHS rest calls.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWithout this change, all the push shuffle metrics will not be rendered correctly through SHS rest calls.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nLaunched Spark-shell application in Yarn client mode in our cluster, get the log file to local, and started a local Spark History Server to parse the log file. The metrics are shown correctly after this patch.",

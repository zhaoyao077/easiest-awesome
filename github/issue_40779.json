  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`DataSet.show()` currently triggers a job for a simple `show tables` command. This is because the command output contains an `isTemporary` boolean column that needs to be casted to string when we use `show()` on the dataset.\r\nThis PR converts `CommandResult` to `LocalRelation` and let `ConvertToLocalRelation` to do the casting locally to avoid triggering job execution.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nA simple `show tables` shouldn not require an executor.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new UT.\r\n",

  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBy default, scripts in `connector/connect/bin` rebuild the necessary JARs using SBT. Even when this build is incremental and there were no changes, the sbt rebuild takes about 4 minutes. Another issue is that launching the `connector/connect/bin/spark-connect`, `connector/connect/bin/spark-connect-shell`, `connector/connect/bin/spark-connect-scala-client` scripts in parallel causes the two sbt builds to clash. So developer has to wait for one to finish before launching the other.\r\n\r\nBy supplying an env var option `BUILD=0` the build step can be skipped:\r\n```\r\nBUILD=0 ./connector/connect/bin/spark-connect\r\nBUILD=0 ./connector/connect/bin/spark-connect-shell\r\nBUILD=0 ./connector/connect/bin/spark-connect-scala-client\r\n```\r\nAt the same time, add a new script `connector/connect/bin/spark-connect-build` to rebuild both the server and client part:\r\n```\r\n./connector/connect/bin/spark-connect-build\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter doing that, it's still slow to have sbt retrieve the classpath of the scala client at each startup. With `connector/connect/bin/spark-connect-scala-client-classpath` and new `SCCLASSPATH` env argument, it's possible to save it to a file:\r\n```\r\nconnector/connect/bin/spark-connect-scala-client-classpath > ./scclasspath\r\nBUILD=0 SCCLASSPATH=$(cat ./scclasspath) connector/connect/bin/spark-connect-scala-client\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImproving inner dev loop.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual build, using the scripts.\r\n",

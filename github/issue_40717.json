  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange tests to avoid replacing and dropping a temporary view that is created in `SubquerySuite#beforeAll`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen I added a test for SPARK-42937, it tried to use the view `t`, which is created in `beforeAll`. But because other tests would replace and drop this view, the new test would fail. As a result, that new test had to re-create `t` from scratch.\r\n\r\nThis change will allow `t` to be used by new tests.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n",

  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn this PR I propose to replace the legacy error class `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_2014`, added as an `IllegalArgumentException` to avoid non-exhaustive case-matching in #22014, with an internal error as it is not triggered by the user space.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAs the error is not triggered by the user space, the legacy error class can be replaced by an internal error.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNo new tests were added and no tests needed changing because of the nature of the updated error class.",

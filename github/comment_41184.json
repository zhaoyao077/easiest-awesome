    "body": "Through the debug plugin scalastyle, I found that the logic of the ImportOrderChecker rule is as follows, for example, in the `ConnectRepl` file, the import order of reference classes is as followsï¼š\r\n<img width=\"541\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/1ba23a98-9f88-4b67-a41a-0862d590eaf0\">\r\n\r\nFirstly, when it iterates through the first import - `import ammonite.compiler.CodeClassWrapper`, it believes that there are no imports related to group `group.java` and `group.scala` at this time. The logic enters the check of the third group (`group.3rdParty`), and the rule we configured at this time only does not allow starting with `org.apache.spark.`. This condition is met, but it is not what we want.\r\n\r\nBy adjusting the regular matching rules of `group.3rdParty` group, the above situation can be avoided. We do not allow starting with `javax?.`, `scala.`, or `org.apache.spark.`.\r\n\r\nPS: The logic of `org.scalastyle.scalariform.ImportOrderChecker` is as follows:\r\n<img width=\"588\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/0b47f217-19c0-4288-8537-c266731ec868\">\r\nhttps://github.com/scalastyle/scalastyle/blob/ec14399543d2d5ccf93c3713aa5df21793844791/src/main/scala/org/scalastyle/scalariform/ImportsChecker.scala#L238-L276\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

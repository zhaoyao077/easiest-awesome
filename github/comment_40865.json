Maybe something like `select *, (select false as result from t1 where t0.a = t1.c limit 1) from t0)`(correct answer for that is also null). (This specific case isn't currently supported though)",

    "body": "@Hisoka-X I think it's clearer to use my example to explain the bug. `NullPropagation` triggers the bug for `(count(1)) is null`, but the root cause is the wrong handling of literals when dealing with the count bug. The bug can be triggered when the scalar subquery has a global aggregate with a constant, which can be produced by `NullPropagation` or by the user query directly.",

  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR improves `ConstantPropagation` rule, the new implementation:\r\n- Collects constants into a map directly, instead of a list that is then transformed into a map.\r\n- Supports substituting in conflicting equalities:\r\n  e.g. `a = 1 AND a = 2` => `a = 1 AND 1 = 2`\r\n  Before this PR this unsatisfiable filter was not reduced:\r\n  ```\r\n  == Physical Plan ==\r\n  *(1) Project [value#219 AS a#222]\r\n  +- *(1) Filter ((isnotnull(value#219) AND (value#219 = 1)) AND (value#219 = 2))\r\n     +- *(1) LocalTableScan [value#219]\r\n  ```\r\n  But after this PR it is:\r\n  ```\r\n  == Physical Plan ==\r\n  LocalTableScan <empty>, [a#222]\r\n  ```\r\n- Allows substitution in other than `EqualTo` and `EqualNullSafe` `BinaryComparison`expressions:\r\n  e.g. `a = 5 AND b < a + 3` => `a = 5 AND b < 8`\r\n- Gets rid of the `Option` wrapper from the return type of `ConstantPropagation.traverse()` as modern `.mapExpressions()`, `.withNewChildren()` and `.mapChildren()` methods can recognize if there was no change in arguments.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove performance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew UTs are taken from @wangyum's PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40093\r\n",

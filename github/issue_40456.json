  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces `DataFrame.withSequenceColumn` to `DataFrame.select(distributed_sequence_column, col(\"*\")` internally because this essentially attaches a column and it should be treated as a scalar expression at the logical level.\r\n\r\nThis is used to generate the unique index only for pandas API on Spark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor better readability of codes, and for cleaner definition of Spark Connect protobuf message, see also https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40270.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, it's internal change only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting test cases in pandas API on Spark verify this change.",

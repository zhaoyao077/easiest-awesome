    "body": "> Thanks for filing a separate JIRA.\r\n\r\nThanks @HyukjinKwon for the quick review!\r\nActually I've just noticed that the SPARK-41468 follow-up PR was only merged to `master` (3.4 at that time) only: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39046#issuecomment-1347975823.\r\nSo probably a simple revert commit (wihtout a new ticket) on 3.4 and `master` would have been sufficient... For the same reason I'm removing the 3.3.2 affect version from SPARK-42852. Please let me know if you disagree.",

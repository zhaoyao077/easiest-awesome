    "body": "Thanks @ShreyeshArangath for this! I think it helps clear a lot of unnecessary noise from user logs and keeps the logs manageable.\r\n\r\nOne thing I noticed is that we set `spark.yarn.report.logging.frequency` to `30` by default. I think it is a much more sensible default, especially given a) Spark jobs submitted to YARN would usually run longer than a minute including the overhead of launching Spark driver b) We always report any state change immediately e.g. `ACCEPTED` -> `RUNNING`. I would be pro defaulting to `30`. But if we want to eliminate behavior change, we can always default it to `1`.\r\n\r\nI saw the tests are failing with what seems to be a transient Github connection issue.\r\n```\r\n/usr/bin/git -c protocol.version=2 fetch --prune --progress --no-recurse-submodules origin +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/* +refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*\r\n  Error: fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/apache/spark/': The requested URL returned error: 429\r\n  The process '/usr/bin/git' failed with exit code 128\r\n```\r\nCan you push an empty commit to re-run the tests?",

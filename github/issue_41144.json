Currently, the Operating system and Java/python versions details are missing in the spark application log, this PR adds that information to the application info log, which will help in troubleshooting and debugging any issues that may arise\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo troubleshoot host-specific issues in the Spark application ran on heterogeneous cluster\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested",

    "body": "Great question @cloud-fan , and actually no, we don't. For all of the other values of `spark.sql.hive.metastore.jars` besides 'builtin', the user JARs are not included at all ([refer to this section of HiveUtils](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/87e3d5625e76bb734b8dd753bfb25002822c8585/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/HiveUtils.scala#L451-L513)). In all of those cases, the JAR list is constructed purely from the dependencies for the specified Hive version. Whether that behavior is correct is another question -- @shardulm94 informed me that user JARs are required to support custom serdes inside of the Hive client -- but in any case, 'builtin' is the only mode that is susceptible to this issue.",

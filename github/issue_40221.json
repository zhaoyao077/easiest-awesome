  "body": "\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFollow on to SPARK-40034, Dynamic/absolute path support in PathOutputCommitters\r\n\r\nDynamic partitioning though the PathOutputCommitProtocol needs to add the target directories to the superclass's partition list else the partition delete doesn't\r\ntake place -the job extends the dataset, rather than replaces it.\r\n\r\nFix:\r\n* add an `addPartition()` method subclasses can use\r\n* add a `getPartitions` method to return an immutable\r\n  copy of the list for testing.\r\n* add the test.\r\n* Also fix `newTaskTempFileAbsPath(`) to return a path, irrespective of committer type.\r\n\r\nIn dynamic mode, because the parent dir of an absolute path is deleted, there's a safety check to reject any requests for a file in a parent dir. This\r\nis something which could be pulled up to HadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol -it needs the same check, if the risk is considered realistic.\r\n\r\nThe patch now downgrades from failing on dynamic partitioning if the committer doesn't declare it supports it to printing a warning. Why this? well, it\r\n*does* work through the s3a committers, it's just `O(data)`. If someone does want to do `INSERT OVERWRITE` then they can be allowed to, just warned about\r\nit. The outcome will be correct except in the case of: \"if the driver fails partway through dir rename, only some of the files will be there\"\r\n\r\nFinally, it update the protocol spec in `HadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol` to cover the dynamic partition job commit in more detail.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n\r\n* The code in SPARK-40034 was incomplete. The new tests show that it works now.\r\n* dynamic partition jobs aren't actually incorrect through the s3 committers, just slow, so if someone really wants it they should be free to.\r\n* The `newFileAbsPath()` code is required of all committers, despite its near-total lack of use.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nUpdates the cloud docs to say that dynamic partition overwrite does work everywhere, just may be really slow.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests in `CommitterBindingSuite`; `\r\n\r\nNew test suite `PathOutputPartitionedWriteSuite extends PartitionedWriteSuite` which runs the `PartitionedWriteSuite` through\r\nthe PathOutputCommitter and with, on hadoop 3.3.5+ the manifest committer chosen.\r\n\r\nexecuted with\r\n* hadoop 3.3.4\r\n* RC2 of hadoop 3.3.5 through `-Dhadoop.version=3.3.5 -Psnapshots-and-staging\r\n",

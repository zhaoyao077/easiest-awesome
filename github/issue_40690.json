  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe PR changes the implementation of MapOutputTracker.updateMapOutput() to search for the MapStatus under the help of a mapping from mapId to mapIndex, previously it was performing a linear search, which would become performance bottleneck if a large proportion of all blocks in the map are migrated.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo avoid performance bottleneck when block decommission is enabled and a lot of blocks are migrated within a short time window.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, it's pure performance improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually test.\r\n",

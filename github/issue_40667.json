  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBuilding the project against jdk11 on IDE shows errors because `Platform.java` depends on `sun.misc` which is in `jdk.unsupported` module in jdk11. The problem goes away when we pass `java.version` as `11` to maven as system D parameters.\r\n\r\nThis PR set `java.version` to `11` by detecting jdk version automatically and improves build experience.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt makes build experience on IDE against jdk11 smoother.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUsers won't have to specify java.version in maven parameters any more since the profile gets activated automagically based on the jdk version.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis patch was tested by building locally.",

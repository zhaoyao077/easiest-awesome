However similar queries in spark sql return correct output column. For groupBy.agg queries on dataframe \"*\" is not expanded correctly in the output column  and the distinct keyword is missing from output column.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// initializing data\r\nscala> val df = spark.range(1, 10).withColumn(\"value\", lit(1))\r\ndf: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [id: bigint, value: int]\r\nscala> df.createOrReplaceTempView(\"table\")\r\n\r\n// Dataframe  aggregate queries with incorrect output column\r\nscala> df.groupBy(\"id\").agg(count_distinct($\"*\"))\r\nres3: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [id: bigint, count(unresolvedstar()): bigint]\r\nscala> df.groupBy(\"id\").agg(count_distinct($\"value\"))\r\nres1: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [id: bigint, count(value): bigint]\r\n\r\n// Spark Sql aggregate queries with correct output column\r\nscala> spark.sql(\" SELECT id, COUNT(DISTINCT *) FROM table GROUP BY id \")\r\nres4: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [id: bigint, count(DISTINCT id, value): bigint]\r\nscala> spark.sql(\" SELECT id, COUNT(DISTINCT value) FROM table GROUP BY id \")\r\nres2: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [id: bigint, count(DISTINCT value): bigint]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded UT",

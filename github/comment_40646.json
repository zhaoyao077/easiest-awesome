As far as I know, Cascade Lake currently used by most users. Compared with Ice lake, Cascade Lake is Intel's previous generation CPU and it does not contains avx512vbmi & avx512_vbmi2 instruction set.  If running the parquet vector optimization on Cascade Lake, it will become very slowly(0.01x), but there is a JDK [Patch](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8290322) to fix this problem, with the patch, it will be 1.7x.  Under normal situation, it will be 5.5x on Ice Lake with Java17. The patch has been merged Java17.",

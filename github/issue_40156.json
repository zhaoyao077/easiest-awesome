  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is the scala version of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39925.\r\n\r\nWe introduce a plan_id that is both used for each plan created by the scala client, and by the columns created when calling `Dataframe.col(..)` and `Dataframe.apply(..)`. This way we can later properly resolve the columns created for a specific Dataframe.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nJoining columns  created using Dataframe.apply(...) does not work when the column names are ambiguous. We should be able to figure out where a column comes from when they are created like this.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUpdated golden files. Added test case to ClientE2ETestSuite.\r\n",

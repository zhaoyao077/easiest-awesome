  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nScheduler micro optimizations to speed up the scheduling loop.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe scheduler is single threaded and the faster we can schedule the faster a query executes. Changes to the scheduler usually adversely affect scheduling throughput which makes it hard to prototype novel changes. Getting some headroom makes experimentation faster while not hurting production.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n",

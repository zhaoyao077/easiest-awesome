If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of AES-CBC mode called via `aes_encrypt` and `aes_decrypt` uses a key derivation function (KDF) based on OpenSSL's [EVP_BytesToKey](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man3/EVP_BytesToKey.html). This is intended for generating keys based on passwords and OpenSSL's documents discourage its use: \"Newer applications should use a more modern algorithm\".\r\n\r\n`aes_encrypt` and `aes_decrypt` should use the key directly in CBC mode, as it does for both GCM and ECB mode. The output should then be the initialization vector (IV) prepended to the ciphertext â€“ as is done with GCM mode:\r\n`[16-byte randomly generated IV | AES-CBC encrypted ciphertext]`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe want to have the ciphertext output similar across different modes. OpenSSL's EVP_BytesToKey is effectively deprecated and their own documentation says not to use it. Instead, CBC mode will generate a random vector.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nAES-CBC output generated by the previous format will be incompatible with this change. That change was recently landed and we want to land this before CBC mode is used in practice.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA new unit test in `DataFrameFunctionsSuite` was added to test both GCM and CBC modes. Also, a new standalone unit test suite was added in `ExpressionImplUtilsSuite` to test all the modes and various key lengths.\r\n\r\nCBC values can be verified with `openssl enc` using the following command:\r\n```\r\necho -n \"[INPUT]\" | openssl enc -a -e -aes-256-cbc -iv [HEX IV] -K [HEX KEY]\r\necho -n \"Spark\" | openssl enc -a -e -aes-256-cbc -iv f8c832cc9c61bac6151960a58e4edf86 -K 6162636465666768696a6b6c6d6e6f7031323334353637384142434445464748\r\n```\r\n",
